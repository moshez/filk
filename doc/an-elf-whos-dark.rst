An elf who's dark

| TTTO What?
| 
| This is a test -- I wrote this song without a "TTO". I don't know how to compose music. I am hoping someone will like this song enough to write a tune for it. If not, I may adapt it to a tune. I don't know.
| 
| Life's exciting!
| 
| Oh -- and another note -- the text was composed on the OLPC image I have running in VMware.

| Drizzt was just another elf, although his skin was dark
| And on his home and family he surely left his mark
| For by the time he left the place, it was no more the same
| Now after more than twenty books we all recite his name
| 
| [Chorus]
| Drizzt, Drizzt, the elf with the black skin
| Who managed to transcend all that's taught by kin
| The scimitars will cut and shred, all battles you will win
| 
| The drow lived in a city and it was below the ground
| A shred of simple honesty was nowhere to be found
| But Drizzt could not live with such rules, he kept true to himself
| His moral inner fiber strong had made him save an elf
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| A dark elf with a trilogy, and then another one
| About the life he chose to live beneath the blazing sun
| He once was cool and special, but alas he is no more
| For now all player characters are good drow in our lore
| 
| [Chorus]
