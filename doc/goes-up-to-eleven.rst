Goes Up to Eleven
-----------------

| TTTO "Hacker's Heaven" by Steve Savtizky
| 
| When you're starting up a rock band, there are two ways to proceed
| Take the time to write good lyrics, or go flat out for speed
| If we let them hear our lyrics, we will never win the race
| So let's get some scary speakers and make sure we got good bass
| 
| [Chorus]
| Let the speakers launch you backwards as we loose a scary yell
| And you're blasting all the people with a billion watts from hell
| Let the others speak of safety, let the other bands be shy
| This one goes to up eleven, don't ask why
| 
| Ten-thousand watt speakers -- there's a reason they are banned
| But when you're in a hurry, you will blast them when you can
| Use a simple chord progression (or just two chords if you dare)
| It may not sound much like music, but just ask me if I care
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| And when we get to stardom, we will rock around the clock
| With out of tune guitars, but it's close enough for rock
| It would take too long to tune them, so we might as well not try
| Besides who wants to wait when it's time to do or die
|  
| [Chorus]
| 
| We will get ourselves some roadies, we will start a brand new craze
| It will be our 15 minutes, though we know it's just a phase
| Let the parents of our fans make sure that they stay in bed
| We'll be acting out our dreams as the ears of fans we shred
| 
| [Chorus]
