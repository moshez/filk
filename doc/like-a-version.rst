Like a Version
--------------

| TTTO "Like a Virgin" by Madona
| 
| It's one of those songs I originally wrote before I knew what filk is. But I rewrote it, since I lost the original.
| 
| I made it through the big test-suite
| Somehow I made it through
| Didn't know how hard it was
| Baby, who knew
| 
| I'm still a bit incomplete
| I have bugs, cruft that did accru
| But you cleaned me up
| Yeah, you cleaned me up
| I know it's hard to do
| 
| [Chorus]
| Like a version
| Out for the very first time
| Like a version
| With the number: 0-dot-9
| 
| Gonna give you all the fame, bot
| I'm still not that fast
| There are still low-hanging fruit
| To optimize we must
| 
| I'm so fine, 0-dot-9
| When the team you have strictly told:
| Oh, the code's in freeze
| Yeah the code's in freeze
| 'Till it's solid from cold
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I'm so fine, 0-dot-9
| Please maintain, 'till the end of time
| 'Cause we have the build
| Yeah, we have the build
| And we upload with pride
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Like a version, ooh, ooh
| Like a version
| Though it's still untried
| When you mold me, I'm released now, and you love me
| 
| Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
| Ooh, baby
| Can't you see the number
| Is just 0-point-9
