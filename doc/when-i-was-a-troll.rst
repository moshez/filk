When I Was a Troll

| TTTO "When I Was a Boy" by Frank Hayes
| 
| When I was a troll, on Kuro5hin (*pronounced corrosion*)
| Leaving some flamebaits for fun
| Getting the newbies to answer
| Now kuro5hin's forgotton, not gone
| 
| But it still beat the postings on sci.math
| Asking that tired old mine
| Querying whether 1.0 is the same
| As 0.99999
| 
| And we wrote all the first posts on slashdot
| Modded them upwards to five
| And petrified Natalie Portman
| Keeping discussions alive
| Back when 4chan was not even three-chan
| And a CAPTCHA? Oh really, how droll!
| And we posted from funny accounts
| When I was a troll
| 
| When I was a troll on ol' usenet
| Posting on comp.language.c 
| Explaining 'bout garbage collection
| And asking on structures for trees
| 
| And you kids who complain that the World Wide Web
| Is spammy oughtta cut out your bitchin'
| 'Cus when I was a troll every flamewar
| Was turned into wars of religion!
| 
| And we wrote all the first posts on slashdot,
| Modded them upwards to five
| And petrified Natalie Portman,
| Keeping discussions alive
| Back when 4chan was not even two-chan
| And a lolcat? Oh really, how droll!
| And we posted from wireless networks
| When I was a troll.
| 
| When I was a troll all the forums
| Were belonging to us where they stood 
| And we wrapped all our memes in macros,
| To protect them as best as we could
| 
| And we made people in hurl in a bucket
| When we linked to some horrible pr0n,
| And we rickrolled and goetsed and tubgirled,
| Because we could not let you down!
| 
| And we wrote all the first posts on slashdot,
| Modding them upwards to five,
| And petrified Natalie Portman,
| Keeping discussions alive
| Back when 4chan was not even one-chan
| And Anonymous? Oh really, how droll?
| And we did all our posting from proxied connections
| When I was a troll
