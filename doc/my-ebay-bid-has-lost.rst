My eBay Bid Has Lost
--------------------

| TTTO Brooke Lunderville's "The Giant Squid Has Not"
| 
| Wanted to buy some off-coloured socks
| Memorabilia and maybe some rocks
| Got here some shocks as the fate cruelly mocks
| Soon I will feel like this is a hoax
| But my eBay bid
| Yeah, my eBay bid
| My eBay bid has lost
| 
| No, my eBay bid was otherwise blown
| My wish for that item was not alone
| Paying some more would require a loan
| That sniper was surely a creep
| When I thought that the item was cheap
| 
| Donald-duck clocks are sold by strange folks
| Highschool jackets sold by ex-jocks
| Down at the docks I bought me a box
| Sold it on eBay, bid on some chalks
| But my eBay bid
| Yeah, my eBay bid
| My eBay bid has lost
| 
| In the stock it does not exist
| It's not on my Amazon's wishlist
| And surely my desire isn't capitalist
| That invisible hand can't reach
| A mind that has been scrubbed by bleach
| 
| Coats from faux-fox or good looking smocks
| Traffic light models stuck showing "walk"
| Dead mounted hawks on hard cinder blocks 
| Crude crayon drawings of all scottish lochs
| But my eBay bid
| Yeah, my eBay bid
| My eBay bid has lost
| 
| But there's one detail I've swept under the rug
| The eBay programming has lots of bugs
| And when you report them you will get a...shrug!
| So if your bid will fall through
| There is naught you can do
| 
| Got in some talks to buy some more lox,
| Saw some ex-monks that sold all their frocks
| Buying some stocks in the school of hard knocks
| Taught me a lesson worse than Iraq's
| But my eBay bid
| Yeah, my eBay bid
| My eBay bid has lost
