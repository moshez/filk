Technology Goes Marching On
---------------------------

| TTTO "Lifa Ha'Eglon" by Arik Einstein
| 
| When I was young, the cells and phones
| Were seperate and quite alone
| But now they have been so combined, you see
| So people call when on the road
| And not just in their own abode
| In constant touch, these people tend to be
| 
| [Chorus]
| Technology goes marching on
| There's so much new beneath the sun
| And we're upgrading without fail
| Oh, hey, you there, you have got mail
| 
| So now we surf the web, world wide
| Where from the news we cannot hide
| With RSS and blogs and instant news
| We have search engines, wikis too
| To learn so much more than we knew
| Of people strange and stranger still their views
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So chips grow smaller, faster still
| They don't stop, and we doubt they will
| So laptops are so cheap and yet so light
| We find the wi-fi when we need
| A blog to write or one to read
| We update, chat and write into the night
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The future, friends, is coming soon
| It's not that bad, it is a boon
| And yet we still do not have cars that fly
| And paper still has stayed right here
| Although I think the time is near
| For paper to wave off and say good-bye
| 
| [Chorus]
