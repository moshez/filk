Go, Johnny, Leave Her
---------------------

| TTTO "Drink Up The River", based on "Leave Her Johnny Leave Her"
| 
| See, "Leave Her Johnny" had every parody you can think of -- from feline evolution to banning from argo. I feel it should have its just deserts.
| 
| ==========================
| 
| I was standing on the deck-side, when the cry had reached my ear
| It was the old man, he was shouting, and the words he said were dear
| And as the journey is now finished, and my god it was so long
| Now I wanted to record my joy, and I did this in this song
| For the weather it was painful, there was wind and there was rain
| And the deck-hands who had worked the trips were in this constant pain
| But now, as we are home again, we should all sing up as one:
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her, the journey's done
| 
| [Chorus]
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her, the journey's done
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her, the journey's done
| 
| Well, throughout the journey's history, the sea it was so high
| The wind it was so foul, and we thought our end was nigh
| To a man we were expecting to get washed up on the shore
| For when fighting hard against the sea is a certain no-win war
| We did not ask for any fortune, just a corner when it's late
| Just to sleep, to rest, a moment's wink -- to nap would be just great
| But as we're coming home, unpacking, let's not think of yesterday
| Let us go now to the shore, my friends, and be there on our way
| Now that you don't fear the flooding, now that you can see the sun
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her, the journey's done
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| All the grub that we were given, it was poison fit to kill
| But we could not help but eat it, and to down it with a swill
| For the money that we're promised it will vanish without trace
| 'Cause to live on such a pittance is not done here in this place
| And we dare not to raise our voices, scream such wages are just wrong
| For we'll be told to stand on planks and then to start to walk along
| And he is now threatening to shoot you with a gun
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her, the journey's done
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now we feel the time we spent on her has robbed us of our life
| There is a feeling of relief now that we're done with all the strife
| And we are hoping that the sea tides will soon carry her away
| So that our eyes will not behold her more, not even for one day
| And as we're leaving her, so gladly, we are starting now to live
| For we gave her all we had, and yet she wanted us to give
| So now sing this final message -- we are leaving in a run
| You've gotta go -- Johnny, leave her, the journey's done
| 
| [Chorus]
