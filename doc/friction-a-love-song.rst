Friction, A Love Song
---------------------

| No tune yet.
| 
| You exert forces on my mass
| You stop me when I go too fast
| Without you I cannot walk
| So at you I will not balk
| 
| [Chorus]
| Friction, you're entropy's loyal friend
| Friction, a law I cannot bend
| Friction, on you I can depend
| Friction, together until the end
| 
| You're called a waste of energy
| But why cannot the others see
| There's no waste, it just transforms
| Into lower, worse, new forms!
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| You make me hot when you are near
| When we're together I never fear
| You stop my falling, my hands are raw
| You my favorite natural law!
| 
| [Chorus]
