| In my car I drive to work, I need to get there soon
| I should have been there nine am and now it's almost noon
| My car does not have honor guard, it does not have a crew
| But now I cannot get all those, and what I must I'll do
| 
| [Chorus]
| Don't cut in, don't cut in, or you'll be dragon bait
| 'Cause I will do all that I must, I don't want to be late
| 
| Ancients legends talk of gods who fly at scary speed
| Though I'm here on the ground, to do the same I need
| And so I'll not be tardy, or not by much, at least
| I don't care who will pay for it, be it man or beast
| 
| I know what's the alternative, to sit here all day long
| So I will drive on sidewalks too, although I know it's wrong
| Here that engine roaring, as I drive over the slow
| Now here's a tip to doing that -- stay in a gear that's low
| 
| The toll of dead is rising, so do what you will, dear sir
| And you -- dear ma'am -- do what you will, I kill both him and her
| I care for debts of honor not at all, nor what is fair
| And if you drive in front of me -- my god, the gall, you dare?
| 
| So don't get on the road unless you'll be there with a tank
| 'Cause I don't care just what you do, or what you claim as rank
| For if I find you in my way, all's fair in drive and war
| The last thing that you will hear shall be my engine's roar
