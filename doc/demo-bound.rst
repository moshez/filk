| "They're looking for a programmer," my buddy said one day
| "'Course, the only thing that's better than the perks you get's the pay,
| But it does mean work in start-up" I said "Get out of my way!"
| And the deadline is looming now
| 
| [Chorus]
| I've been working 12 hour days now, since we begun
| I've been working 12 hour days now, we're almost done
| I've been working 12 hour days and hey it almost runs
| And the demo is working now
| 
| There is a product being built, it's lots of lines of code
| We're hoping and we're praying that it won't crash and explode
| The effort's astronomical, the show is on the road
| And the demo is working now
| 
| We've written all our test suites and we hacked until they passed
| And every bug that now we find -- we're sure that it's the last
| It's looking so impressive that we're sure it's unsurpassed
| And the demo is working now
| 
| I'm drinking lots of coffee so I can keep working late
| I'm eating lots of calories and gaining lots of weight
| But though I'm dead and tired, I'm really feeling great
| 'Cause the demo is working now
| 
| I've written all my code and now my heart is in my throat
| And if it doesn't work right, there's a chance that they won't note
| We're learning all the speaking parts 'till we know them by rote
| And the demo is working now
| 
| We mean to build this product to be used throught the 'verse
| And though the demo is OK, it wasn't too diverse
| So now there's bugs from users and we fix them and we curse
| Though the demo is working now
