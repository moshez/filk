Rhyme after Rhyme
-----------------

| TTTO "Time after Time", Cyndie Lauper
| 
| Singing on this stage I hear the fiddle
| And realize
| Caught up in chords and melody
| Not that wise
| Blackout -- mind blank
| Lyrics were left behind
| They had some great ones --
| Rhyme after--
| 
| Sometimes I think of words
| In verses too far ahead
| You're shouting at me, "wrong verse"
| I think you've said
| Then you say -- you've left
| The sheet behind
| The music makes me blind
| 
| [Chorus]
| If you've lost all the words -- then just make them up
| Rhyme after rhyme
| If Frank Hayes has now hit you -- rewrite your lyrics
| Rhyme after rhyme
| 
| After my song is done, the music will
| Fade away
| Some words were wrong, you're wondering
| If it's OK
| Dumb lines stolen from songs I heard
| The drum beats had me scared
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Then you say -- you've left
| The sheet behind
| The music makes me blind
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| ...Rhyme after rhyme
| Rhyme after rhyme
| Rhyme after rhyme
| Rhyme after rhyme
