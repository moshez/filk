| Well you're a real supervillain -- at least so I hear --
| So you use traps of death, like the one in here
| That's OK, I think there's nothing to it,
| I'll escape, and you can watch me do it
| 
| [Chorus]
| Kill me with your pet shark,
| Why don't you kill me with your pet shark
| Kill me with your pet shark --
| That's what I say!
| 
| You use a lot of minions, you don't fight fair,
| But I have science knowledge, you don't stand a prayer
| Tie me up, it's all in vain
| Supervillains cannot match my brain
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Well you're a real supervillain -- at least so I hear --
| So you use  traps of death, like the one in here
| And soon I'll pull an unlikely escape
| Using nothing but some a paper clip and rolls of tape
| 
| [Chorus]
| [Chorus]
