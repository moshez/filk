I Can't Cook
------------

| TTTO "I Can't Dance", Genesis
| 
| Hot stove's never fun
| Burning my food 'fore I notice it's done
| 
| Hot stove, making me sweat
| So I run out of the kitchen just as fast as a jet
| 
| I can't cook and I can't bake
| But I know how to buy it, it's enough to fake
| I can't cook -- nor deep fry
| If I had to eat my cooking I would starve and die
| 
| Some friends tried to teach
| The timing must be perfect but it's just out of reach
| 
| I just manage to get food on my shirt
| I might as well be making some mud pies out of dirt
| 
| 'Cos I can't cook and I can't bake
| But I know how to buy it, it's enough to fake
| I can't cook -- nor deep fry
| If I had to eat my cooking I would starve...
| 
| I can't find anything in this place
| Like the button to turn this on
| 
| Hot oil, sizzling my shoes
| I think that this whole cooking thing is just a ruse
| 
| Thick smoke, and my kitchen it through
| I'm never touching ovens is my newest rule
| 
| But I can't cook and I can't bake
| But I know how to buy it, it's enough to fake
| I can't cook -- nor deep fry
| If I had to eat my cooking I would starve...
| 
| I can't find anything in this place
| Like the button to turn this on
| And this cooking -- is too much to face
| 
| No I can't cook and I can't bake
| But I know how to buy it, it's enough to fake
| I can't cook -- nor deep fry
| If I had to eat my cooking I would starve and die
| 
| If I had to eat my cooking...I would starve and die
