| Life's a channel, there are the joins and parts
| And when the convo starts
| We tend to use our larts
| It's alright if some answers are just wrong
| They'll get corrected before long
| Within a light-furlong
| 
| The intarweb is great
| Every download's a gift
| Software can segfault
| Pair while you write code
| So hard
| All day
| 
| To be like other channels
| To fit in in this glittering network
| Don't give us chats
| Don't give us chats
| Give us something to chat about
| 
| Life's a channel you don't get to be op on
| And if you are alone
| It's like holding up a ton
| Still my friends don't know why I /ignore
| The million chumps or more
| When their code is such eyesore
| 
| All the privmsgs they send
| Family and friends
| The DCC abends
| Well that
| Depends
| On if Mr. Joe
| On if he knows enough to know
| That when you ask
| Listening to the answer's
| Your task
| 
| There was no pain
| No fear, no doubt
| Til I joined the channel
| So that's my refrain
| I live in hell
| Because I chose to join the channel
| I think I joined the channel
| So give me something to chat about
| Please give me something...
| 
| Newbie:
| Life's not a channel
| You should get a life
| Or maybe a wife: start living
| You'll get more calm
| And answers you'll give
| You'll get less vindictive by living
| You really should start living
| At least one of should be living
