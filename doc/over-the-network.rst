Over the Network
----------------

| TTTO "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", 
| 
| Somewhere over the network
| Servers die
| Hard drives breaking and grinding
| My data goes bye-bye
| 
| Somewhere over the network
| They are screwed
| For the backups are also gone
| This is far from good
| 
| Restore the data from a tar
| It is a hope that is too far
| Above them
| Now trouble comes like summer crops
| And once it starts it never stops
| That's what will kill them
| 
| Somewhere over the network
| Packets fly
| Packets fly through the network
| Even though servers die
| 
| Though TCP packets go through
| The global network
| Servers will always die
