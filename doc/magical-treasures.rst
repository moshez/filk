Magical Treasures
-----------------

| TTTO "הלילות הקסומים" by The Witches
| 
| Hook, cliche, a clue, a map
| Wake up early from your nap
| Strap your sword and bring your picks
| Learn your spells, rehearse your tricks
| 
| Gonna crawl through dungeons soon
| Challenges along them strewn
| Make no sense, but we don't care
| We just want our treasure's share
| 
| [Chorus]
| It's so much fun, just to hack and to slash
| Kill the monsters with swords, or with mace heads to bash
| So a fighter, a wizard, a thief and a priest
| Are slashing through evil and slaying the beasts
| 
| Monsters have some magic stuff
| But we know it's not enough
| If we brave this dungeon through
| We'll find treasure, please our crew
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So we reached this dungeon's end
| And I cannot recommend
| Doing what we have now done
| Treasure was already gone
| 
| [Chorus]
