Banned From PyCon
-----------------

| TTTO "Banned from Argo" by Leslie Fish
| 
| When we arrived in PyCon, we saw all the Python stars
| Sitting and conversing in the hotel lounge bar
| We had high expectations of their hospitality
| But found too late it wasn't geared for hackers such as we
| 
| [Chorus]
| And we're banned from PyCon, that's too bad
| Banned from PyCon, and the lot of us are sad
| Tutorials and sprints, and open spaces -- we want more
| But PyCon just won't let us in the door
| 
| Though Python's pretty simple, we all want it more complex
| We wrote a PEP describing a new method -- __sex__ (Prounounced "under-sex")
| They told us it's no good, and that it doesn't stand a chance
| Especially the part where we proposed __romance__
| 
| We all like drinking beers, and we all like to share them too
| Bought round after round for the whole commiter crew
| The team had started coding when the bar announced "last call"
| It might explain the errors when I try the new install
| 
| Python's quite high-level, so we thought it wasn't green
| To write Python in Python -- oh, please, really, it's obscene
| Now the PyPy bunch is after us, we're much the worst for wear
| Italian, Dutch and Polish -- in all those they know to swear!
| 
| We asked a simple question, "Why Mercurial, not Bazaar"
| "From features that we needed it just doesn't seem to far"
| "Or Git, or SVN, or something else without a doubt!"
| So all the core commiters beat us up and kicked us out
| 
| We asked around, because we saw that nobody quite gets
| The proper way of using Twisted writing programs net-
| working, so we said "we'll just redo it, to be clean"
| The will is there but the code is not, our blog's what people've seen
| 
| We love to love humanity, we love the peace and quiet
| But we could not pass up the chance to incite Perl 6 to riot
| And so they challenged Guido, and the rest is history--
| With pies that fly about as we sat and drunk our tea
| 
| We love to use the wireless, and the wireless loves us too
| But only when it's tummy doing what they know to do
| For otherwise the networking won't work, yes, such is life
| 6 gadgets for each geek will make the air with wi-fi rife
| 
| A bunch of Ruby people and nobody seemed to care
| They came in for our summit, but we wondered how they dare
| We made some fun of RoR but they don't want to play
| So when they started the stampede we turned and ran away
| 
| We like to code in Python and this hobby we don't hide
| And having fun in PyCon was a joyful funny ride
| We're sorry 'bout the trouble, didn't mean to cause a fuss
| At least we're sure that PyCon won't be quick forgetting us
