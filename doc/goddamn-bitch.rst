| Carl, the interfilk guest, said he cannot write funny songs about break-ups. I decided to treat it as a challenge...

| TTTO Tom Smith's "Suit of Armor" (from iTom)
| 
| The sacred vow of a wife is to keep her faith all true
| It does not matter what white knight rides to her rescue
| While gratefulness is awesome, it is a virtue, so?
| Yeah, I know all that, it's no excuse, our relationship to blow
| 
| We really needed money and I stayed at work all night
| When a noise in the dark, apparently, gave my wife a fright
| The night was cool, the breeze was soft, and she went right outside
| She didn't even have the sense, you see, in home to hide
| 
| Well, right behind, Sir Gallywho says "Can I help you, ma'am
| I see you're still in underwear, and, oh my breath, goddamn"
| And so instead of slapping him, his offer she did take
| She actually then went inside his house, the lying snake
| 
| And so, you can all guess my friends, what happened in that place
| A married woman, and a neighbour, oh my what a disgrace
| And when I got back, I was told "you're not needed anymore
| Here is your stuff, we'll happily then show you to the door"
| 
| Now, I couldn't rightly tell you who did what to whom or how,
| But I honestly can't say that I care much about the cow
| And so I left her with that man, I hope they rot in hell
| And let him just remember, that where I slipped, he fell
| 
| For now his wife, you can say, that the woman gets around
| But she became much smarter now, and so she isn't found
| So now I'm freakin' happy that I'm out on my own
| It would have ended sooner, if only I had known
