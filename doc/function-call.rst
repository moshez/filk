Function Call

| This time it's gonna be the time
| That you're gonna be branching back
| By now, you should've somehow
| Realized that you're going back
| I don't believe that anybody
| Needs, in any way, the ret code now
| 
| PUSH/POP, the way you're gonna hop
| And execute this ugly hack
| I'm sure, you kept the running score
| Of the bits that you gotta back
| I don't believe that anybody
| Needs, in any way, the ret code now
| 
| And all the code that has to run is grinding
| And all the stack that led us here's unwinding
| There are many ways that I could
| Make it be so fast but
| There was no ACK
| 
| Because maybe
| The malloc that you did has been freed
| And after all
| You're a function call
| 
| This time was gonna be the time
| But you'll never be branching back
| By now you should've somehow 
| Realized that they smashed the stack
| I don't belive that anybody
| Needs, in any way, the retcode now
| 
| And all the code you ran so fast was grinding
| And all the stack you had to push's unwinding
| There are many ways that I have
| Tried to make it fast
| There was no ACK
| 
| I said maybe
| The malloc that you did has been freed
| And after all
| You're a function call
| 
| I said maybe
| The malloc that you did has been freed
| And after all
| You're a function call
| 
| Said maybe
| The malloc that you did has been freed
| The malloc that you did has been freed
| The malloc that you did has been freed
