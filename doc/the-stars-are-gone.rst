| 
| 'Cause we will all fall, and we will all land
| But we don't know where that place might be
| So we'll run and hide, we'll not make a stand
| And soon like Diane I know I'll be
| 
| [Chorus]
| When the Spin is on, and the night is black
| We know not, guess not, when the stars come back
| And the world will spiral down to hell
| Since the time the black Spin curtain fell
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| We have done some tests, and we see this now
| From the universe we're cut away
| And although we tried, we cannot know how --
| Time has been sped up and we will decay
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So we send them off to go settle Mars
| For humanity must stay alive
| But it's not for long they will see the stars
| They get Spinned there too, as soon as they thrive
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Bridge:
| Stars in the sky are back, could it be the end is here?
| How can we deal with that, 'till now it has all been clear
| What if we sail away, leave here all that we have known
| With those who have the faith, with them we'll not be alone
| 
| Still the Martian guy, he came from that place
| With the drugs and nanobots and plan
| We have took the drugs, the plan we embraced
| And we now escape in that plain white van
| 
| [Chorus]
| And the world will spiral down to hell
| Since the time the black Spin curtain fell
