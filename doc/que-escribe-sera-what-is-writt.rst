| When I was just a girl in school
| I asked my watcher, what will I be
| Will I be pretty, will I be rich,
| Here's what he said to me
| 
| Que escribe sera
| Whatever's in prophecy
| The future has been foretold, my child
| Que escribe sera
| What they wrote will be
| 
| After I year, before my death
| I asked my watcher, what lies ahead
| Will I survive this, will I succeed
| Here's what my watcher said
| 
| Que escribe sera
| Whatever's in prophecy
| The future has been foretold, my child
| Que escribe sera
| What they wrote will be
| 
| I clinically died, and lived again
| I asked my watcher, what will I be
| Will someone love me, what's wrong with me
| He told me tenderly
| 
| Que sera, sera,
| Whatever will be, will be
| The future's not ours, to see
| Que sera, sera
| What will be, will be.
