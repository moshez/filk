Wild Guess
----------

| Tune: original
| 
| A song about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler-Mascheroni_constant#Properties">properties of the Euler-Mascheroni constant</a>
| 
| If you sum one over k,
| And you just won't stop at all
| It will not stop on its way,
| Though it rises at a crawl
| If you subtract a log, base e
| At each step along your path
| It converges you will see
| Take time to do the math!
| 
| Gamma is the limit's name
| It's easy to approximate
| But you cannot hope to claim
| We know something of its fate
| Our math is still not quite enough
| To know its properties, you see
| But here's a guideline that is rough
| And I hope you will agree
| 
| [Chorus]
| You should know the odds if you have to bet
| And the odds are a zero to one
| So I'm gonna say no, though I'm gonna sweat
| For a shred of a proof I have none
| 
| Can we find two numbers whole
| Their division to be this
| If this is to be your goal
| Your hope and prays I will dismiss
| Rationality is rare
| It is much too much to hope
| And though I did not say its fair
| I am going to say "nope"
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| If it's irrational, you see
| Still polynomials abound
| Whose co-efficients are in Z
| Perhaps one of them can be found
| Such that one among its roots
| Is this Gamma that we seek
| My guess it will bear little fruits
| Though my arguments are weak
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Algebraic over pi
| Or algebraic over e
| Oh, tell me, why you try
| Why you cannot let this be
| It's so easy just to guess
| To just give up and say "no"
| We are not assured success
| Though the odds are good, you know
| 
| [Chorus]
