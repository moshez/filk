| I am fond of Peter Parker, and Spider Man
| But I also like Clark Kent, and Super Man
| And I love the Hulk, if he's grey or he's green
| I really adore Wolverine and no matter if he's mean
| 
| [Chorus]
| Oh, I love when they're gentle, and I love it when they're tough
| Or when their face is exposed -- oh I can't get enough
| When they're framed for a murder, or some heinous crime
| And they have to prove it's not them, or they'll have to do some time
| 
| I like Bubbles and Blossom -- and Buttercup
| And I really like Shira, and I know I'll get some rap
| But if you ask me my favourite, I know where I put my money
| 'Cause what I really really love...is My Little Pony
| 
| [Chorus]
