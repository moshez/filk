Miss the Cache
--------------

| TTTO "לבקש ת'קש" by "שבק ס"
| 
| I'm counting on having this song being cut short anyway with groans, so I only did the first verse.
| 
| I know how you want it: dynamic and fast
| A site that is the top, one that is unsurpassed
| JavaScript and CSS, AJAX and theming
| And the music downloading and the video streaming
| But servers all crawl, they are slowing
| They are close to being dead from all the traffic snowing
| But now the maintainance they're undergoing
| And slowly but surely the results are showing
| The site is now slightly less hard to scale
| And with a little bit of luck, it will not fail
| I now am up on all my work and I have read my mail
| Though the balance we achieved it is so weak and frail
| I am the network admin, not a web code monkey
| I am addicted to the shell, and I'm a packet junky
| 
| Because this protocol is making me, miss the cache
| And the servers are all crashing 'cause I miss the cache
| When I miss the cache, please tell me what to do?
| I need the code: 304, your version's true
