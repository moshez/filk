A Distraction
-------------

| TTTO "Elevation" by U2
| 
| Based on the movie of LotR:RotK, when Gimli said "A distraction!"
| 
| Fight, fight with Sauron
| You will not fight alone
| I need you to be my ally here
| We won't be saved by ships
| And not by clever quips
| From trips
| We must distract them all
| 
| It's out of control
| Been fighting with some trolls
| Facing death and destruction
| Now please don't cry
| And even though we'll lose we'll try
| We die
| For distraction!
| 
| It's far
| We can't know where they are
| For hobbits we now spar
| We just hope that they will throw the ring
| 
| We'll help them with their goals
| To die here is our role
| The goal is some distraction
| 
| A troll
| Fighting in a hole
| To be here is my goal now
| Facing death and destruction
| 
| There's an eye in the sky
| It sought the hobbits 'till we pried
| We try
| For distraction
| 
| Friends
| Our fate we now can choose
| We'll die here, it is true
| This is what we'll do
| 
| A troll
| Fighting in a hole
| To be here is my goal now
| Facing death and destruction
| 
| There's an eye in the sky
| It sought the hobbits 'till we pried
| We try
| For distraction
|
