Debugging Software

| Well I almost decided to marry you
| But that ain't the right thing for me to do
| You don't love me darlin, now I see,
| It's the help debugging software so that you can watch that new DVD
| 
| All those nights I dated you at your home
| It wasn't 'cause you didn't wanna be alone
| It's because of those great hacks you got from me
| Like the help debugging software so that you can watch that new DVD
| 
| You were always sweet, you were never rude
| But before we could get naked and lewd
| I'd buzz through your laptop like a bumblebee
| And I'd help debugging software so that you can watch that new DVD
| 
| You thought your boobs were the key to my heart
| Now I realize you're kinda smart
| There's a reason to marry me
| 'Cause I help debugging software so that you can watch that new DVD
| 
| I ain't that good lookin'
| But I'm into bookin
| Installing "quicken"
| With the OS I'm dickin'
| It's making me high
| To configure wi-fi
| When I help debugging software 
| Or getting rid of malware
| When I help debugging software so that you can watch that new DVD
