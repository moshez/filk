| I used to talk to my friends
| Never sent S-M-S
| But now my cell phone just sends
| Text, and I talk less and less
| But because space is tight
| The English just ain't right
| 
| I know I can't spell
| How else could it be
| "kthxbye" looks right to me
| It's shorter, you can tell
| gtg, I'll brb
| I now type so easily
| 
| I saw a world enchanted
| Laughter was in the air
| But now I take for granted
| With a "lolz" I can bring you there
| 'Cause dude, that just pwnz
| When I dl all these ring-tones
| 
| I know I can't spell
| Nothing I can do
| But I know I will be CNU
| I just can't type so well
| Finally I knew
| That you can spell "you" as "u"
| 
| It made me type more
| 
| I think it's just gr8
| I like to txt with my m8
| 
| I know I can't spell
| It's not important, IIRC
| I'll BRB, 'cause G2P
| Spelling is a hell
| Typing words is misery
| Typing letters makes me free
| 
| No auto com-plete
| No auto com-plete
| No auto com

| [spoken]
| I bet they're not even working
| They're...typing. With one hand.
