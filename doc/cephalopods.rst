| 
| C                           G
| They like to come out from the sea
| C                       G
| They like to eat each other's flesh
| C                                 G
| And when they come, you better flee
| C                              G
| To them your blood will taste quite fresh
| 
| [Chorus]
| C                    C
| Cephalopods say creepy stuff
| F                                C
| You thought that you were safe on land
| C                            C
| But they are quite a bit more tough
| F                             C
| The sea was where they schemed and planned
| 
| Racoons are scary beasts indeed
| They're friends with octopi and squids
| They'd like for you to join them bleed
| I would not trust them with the kids
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| If you're a dinosaur king
| The lord of all your eyes survey
| Just know ye that the sea might bring
| The squids and octopi to prey
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The dinosaurs, we all know,
| Have died -- they all became extinct
| And now you see, where did they go,
| I think these things just might be linked
| 
| [Chorus]
