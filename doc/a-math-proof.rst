A Math Proof
------------

| No tune yet.
| Dedicated to all those people who "undermine" accepted math by writing complete and utter nonsense.
| 
| You say the real numbers are a lie
| You say that they're not well defined
| You say there is no such thing as PI
| And no such thing as the length of a line
| 
| [Chorus]
| You're a nut, you're a kook
| Stop referring to your book
| Please stop writing this drivel
| If you want us to be civil
| 
| You wrote a paper, "Cantor Is Wrong"
| But the proof is just fine, sorry bud
| You and math, it seems, don't get along
| See this paper's a gibberish flood
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Math is black and white, you troll
| If there's a proof, there's a proof
| And I don't mean half-percent alcohol
| Which is what you've been drinking, you goof
| 
| [Chorus]
