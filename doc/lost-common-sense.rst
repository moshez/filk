Lost Common Sense
-----------------

| TTTO "המגפיים של ברוך"
| 
| So he got a book of spells
| And he figured what the hell
| And he read the spells and started to do magic
| To good sense he said goodbye
| Did some cool stuff, "just to try"
| Out of the window was thrown out all the logic
| 
| Soon his friends paid some mind
| A solution tried to find
| But he would not budge, he liked to play with fire
| So they left him to himself
| When the book he would not shelf
| And they said that this whole thing was pretty dire
| 
| [Chorus]
| For when you do spells, you must take care
| Of consequences, you must beware
| But when you're starting to do magic it's so easy to get lost
| You will only notice when you pay the cost
| 
| When a demon was let loose
| Then he quickly offered truce
| Serve the demon in return for mystic teaching
| And the demon said OK
| It was good loot for the day
| For his darkened soul he knew he'll soon be reaching
| 
| When the demon had his chance
| Stole the man's soul with a glance
| And he ended all of life as we did know it
| For the world it was too late
| Magic sealed its sorry fate
| Common sense comes back to bite you when you throw it
| 
| [Chorus]
