Dumb computers, only trouble
----------------------------

| TTTO "Science Fiction, Double Feature" from Rocky Horror Picture Show
| 
| Michael Rennie was ill
| The day his box stood still
| When it grinded to a stand
| When he called me, I swear
| I was in underwear
| He would not let me do what I planned
| Then something went wrong
| When I was driving along
| It got caught in an infinite loop
| Condition of a race
| It came from cyberspace
| And then it crashed in one fell swoop
| 
| [Chorus]
| Dumb computers, only trouble
| All that's left now -- only rubble
| 'Cause when you fix stuff you'll only break it
| Unless its etchers, don't try to shake it
| Wo oh oh oh oh oh
| Dumb computers, just avoid them, just say no
| 
| So if you use a machine
| That never does what you mean
| Well you have to acquire some skills
| And I get really annoyed
| When the box gets destroyed
| You know, ignorance sometimes kills
| When you fiddle the bits
| Without using your wits
| Then technicians will stick you with bills
| So step away from the keys
| We are asking you, please
| When you stand there, my back's feeling chills
| 
| [Chorus]
