Doom Shooting
-------------

| TTTO "California Dreaming", The Mamas and the Papas
| 
| All the rockets launch
| Keeping foes at bay
| They all came from hell
| Zombies, here to stay
| 
| Opened up a door
| I found along my way
| Well I got the shotgun here
| Jumped into the fray
| 
| You know the zombies like the dark
| They're not kept at bay
| And I hope it's not my doom here
| But they're here to stay
| 
| All the rockets launch
| Keeping foes at bay
| They all came from hell
| Zombies, here to stay
| 
| If I didn't get shot
| I would live today
| And I hope it's not my doom here
| Zombies, here to stay
