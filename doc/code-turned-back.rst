Code Turned Back
----------------

| TTTO "The Bow's Turned Back", Heather Alexander.
| 
| Dana wrote a beautiful song to the tune, in Hebrew, called <a href="http://www.fuzzy-fish.com/wordpress-he/archives/328">Ad E'laich</a>. I translated it into English.
| 
| When the night turns lonely, I think of you only
| As I sit and stare at the screen
| Your bugs astound me, like drugs confound me,
| As confused as I ever have been
| It is getting late -- oh my god, it's eight
| And the office is empty and dark
| But I'll still remain, and compile again,
| "We're alone now," we both remark
| 
| [Chorus]
| For the threads are runnin', the code is cunnin',
| And the bits are zero and one
| And the bytes are shiftin', the code's upliftin'
| The hours so quickly are gone
| 
| For the work so hard, you can't disregard
| One more colon, or half of such
| In my dreams, you tease, as the deadlocks freeze
| And I shudder awake with a touch
| You become so cold, as the programs fold
| And the shutdown's sequence complete
| But at dawn, next day, with the sun's first ray
| Once again, we both know, we will meet
| 
| If they say a machine from all feelings is clean,
| I'll not know if to cry or to laugh
| For I know you well, I can surely tell
| You feel more than humanity's half
| You are new and fresh, you're not bone and flesh
| You have left me with nary a choice
| I need you to live, may the gods forgive
| None will cry and I will rejoice
| 
| As the voltage risin', and I'm revisin',
| Myself, my being, my all
| As my programs are being installed
| The chains of the flesh disappear
| In this dream of an engineer
| 
| [Chorus]
