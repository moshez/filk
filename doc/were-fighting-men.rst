We're fighting men
------------------

| Because I wanted to write a song about "Starship troopers"
| 
| TTTO "Aquarius", from Hair
| 
| [Repeat whole song twice]
| When the ship is is gearing up to stop
| And we get in our suits to land
| Then war is gonna come to town
| We'll fight and run, just as we planned
| 
| Don't mess with the MI -- we're trained and fighting men
| Trained and fighting men
| We're fighting men
| 
| Hand to hand or with flame-throwers
| Our corps now this town lowers
| No more threats or diplomatics
| Gonna fire automatics
| Jumping for the liberation
| Of our race and of our nation
| We're fighting men
