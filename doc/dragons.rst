Dragons
-------

| TTTO Julia Ecklar's "Tribbles"
| 
| The books are all repetitive
| The dreams are all the same
| The fantasy is constant now
| I'm not sure who to blame
| 
| The shelves, all bright and full now
| The genre's going strong
| But these are all so boring
| And try hard to be long --
| 
| Dragons in all fantasy
| Their roars so fill the air
| Their fires flame all citizens
| They fly from here to there
| 
| So far they've gotten so cliche
| And all the authors write
| About them, and their ravages
| The knights, with dragons fight
| 
| Now as reader, am I quite obliged
| To suffer this? What for
| The books with elves and dragons all,
| My god, they're such a bore
| 
| Dragons, now in sf too,
| McCaffrey, you would dare
| Sully this new genre too
| Where dragons were so rare
| 
| Some have cool tricks, like acid breath or
| Hypnotic, scary gaze
| In earthsea they all speak true speech
| In some books they just laze
| 
| There's no race much more common
| Except for, maybe, elves
| In singles, or in families,
| In books packed on the shelves
| 
| Now fans are trying very hard
| To not get bored so fast
| They keep on reading more and more
| Of spells the dragons cast
| 
| Dragons in our Harry slash
| In Harry het as well
| And I wish I could kill them all
| When they hatch from the shell
| 
| Our books would not be so cliche
| New monsters, they would find
| We'd have some more diversity
| We'd break out of this bind
| 
| But I shall never get my wish
| New books, the same old thing
| The dragons have not gone away
| To fantasy they cling
| 
| And in my sleeping, late at night
| Of dragons, now I dream
| These beasts with wings and breath of flame
| Of nostrils blowing steam
| 
| Dragons, they won't let me be
| Sleeping, or awake,
| I wish that we could all decide
| From dragons, take a break
