| How great is the need to twist and to maim
| Some think that filking is awefully lame
| But a pun and a wink and a joke that's obscure
| Is good trade for a song (or is it? I'm unsure)
| 
| What gift can I find in return for this prize?
| When you sing me the songs that bring tears to my eyes
| I can take all your lyrics and twist them around
| The look will be new, but the same ol' good sound
| 
| Chorus:
| I will fashion a pun with a twist of my mind
| For the lyrics you sing, I will give back in kind
| I will poke, prod and push, every rhyme I will milk
| A lifetime of song's worth a lifetime of filk
| 
| I can take from your tune, 'till you wish it had died
| I can't write songs from scratch, so my time I will bide
| When you have a new song, that you'll wish I ignore
| I will chuckle and publish new lyrics galore
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| This vow that you made will be my way to fame
| For each song that you write is a new tune I claim
| Be it loud hard-rock drumming or a nice quiet song
| With each new creation my filking grows strong
| 
| [Chorus]
| [Chorus]
