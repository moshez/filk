Drift Away

| 
| For solid land, oh, my heart is yearning
| The rest -- they all think me weak
| For food and comfort my heart is yearning
| My future seems so bleak
| 
| For solid land, oh, my heart is yearning
| Sailors don't lose belief
| For food and comfort my heart is yearning
| From pain, I dream of relief
| 
| For solid land, oh, my heart is yearning
| There's naught I'm proud of
| For food and comfort my heart is yearning
| Warm food right from the stove
| 
| In my stomach -- hunger burning
| Frostbitten are my feet
| Only now we're slowly learning
| How to conceit defeat
| 
| Oh, for solid land, I'm yearning -- yes yearning
| Oh, for solid land, I'm yearning -- yes yearning
| For solid land, oh, my heart is yearning
| So long since I lost belief
| Just trouble now, oh this journey's earning
| I'll never know relief
