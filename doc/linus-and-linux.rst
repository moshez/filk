Linus and Linux
---------------

| TTTO "Goliat" by Kaveret
| 
| Once in ancient history,
| UNIX was a mystery
| Code was closed and hidden,
| From the hackers eyes a-prying
| But a guy from lands of cold
| Wrote a new one, and he told
| "Read the code, it's free for all
| I don't mind any spying"
| 
| Bugs were there, but shallow all
| For the law that's "Linus" called
| If we work together
| We will find them to the last one
| Change and distribute it please
| But just don't be a big sleaze
| Give us all the sources
| You had yours, let us have our fun
| 
| All other UNIXes, they fought until they died
| But with Linus as the leader, and with GNU there at our side
| We are sharing our code with GPL
| 
| It got ported everywhere
| 64 bits -- not a care
| Where the GCC has worked
| Then Linux's sure to follow
| SMP was no big deal
| Now the kernel lock is pealed
| All the patches going 'round
| The tree was sure to swallow
| 
| All other UNIXes, they fought until they died
| But with Linus as the leader, we knew that we could trust our guide
| We would wait for the mail with the release:
| 
| Read the patches, bugs have been fixed, now please patch if you will
| Please compile, install the kernel, it does not take much skill
| Read the patches, bugs have been fixed, now please patch if you will
| We disclaim responsibility if boxes you kill
| 
| Distributions take it all
| Roll it up into a ball
| Put it on a CD
| Or the web for downloading 
| Put up fixes for the bugs
| All holes they so swiftly plug
| To prevent computers
| From the cracking and exploding
| 
| Linus now is not alone
| Happy so to share his throne
| With the people who have helped
| To code this damn fine kernel
| Now so many people know
| Understand the program's flow
| They can fix the bugs because
| They understand internals
| 
| All other UNIXes, they matter less and less
| For with Linus as our leader, we can now proclaim sucess
| Though now others, send mail with the release:
| 
| Read the patches, bugs have been fixed, now please patch if you will
| Please compile, install the kernel, it does not take much skill
| Read the patches, bugs have been fixed, now please patch if you will
| We disclaim responsibility if boxes you kill
| 
| Read the patchs for bugs have been fixed --
| And some more features in there mixed --
| Now please patch if you kindly will
