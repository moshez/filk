It's Always Morning Somewhere in the World (But not here)
---------------------------------------------------------

| To get the tune, I recorded <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?5gczung10aq">myself singing</a>
| 
| The sun is coming out now, birds are chirping merrily
| I really should got out of bed, my body's telling me
| It's almost noon, I'm ill at ease, I want to sleep some more
| The sun, its light is meant to tease, to tell me what's the score
| 
| [Chorus]
| My body, it is so confused,
| My inner clock is oh so wrong
| My body, it has been abused,
| Don't think it's sure where it belongs
| 
| I turn around in my bed, and close my eyes again
| Though morning has appeared by now, I have to rest my brain
| If I don't get the sleep I should, I won't be worth a thing
| I will to bed, with stubborness and desperation, cling
| 
| I've turned and tossed too much by now, I'm finally awake
| But could it be, I'm feeling now, there has been some mistake
| It's dark the people are alseep, the morning -- it's not here
| I've missed it geographically, it's elsewhere on this sphere
