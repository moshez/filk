No Such Vampire
---------------

| TTTO "No such Thing", Zander Nyrond
| 
| On a day of wind and rain, my daughter said to me:
| "The caves are full of things today, oh mommy, can't you see?"
| "What kind of things?" I asked her, as my face was growing pale
| "There's demons and vampires, they kill in Sunnydale"
| So I sat her at the table, and I looked all motherly
| And I told her "Stop this foolishness and listen well to me"
| 
| Chorus:
| There's no such thing as demons
| The vampires are not real
| If you can't face reality
| Your mind we'll have to heal
| 
| But now my daughter's quiet, and denial is my game
| I wash the blood from clothes worn, ignoring what's to blame
| And I know it's not forever, for a slayer has to die
| That day we'll stand around the plot, say platitudes and cry
| We will choose a careful wording for the headstone on the grave
| For the world will still not know of her, the world she died to save
| 
| [Chorus]
