Evil Meow
---------

| TTTO "Evil Laugh", Seanan McGuire
| 
| If you wanna be specific, it was upholsterific
| Oh this couch is so grand --
| It is cozy and fantastic, it was leather -- it is classic
| It is here I'll sleep and stand!
| 
| And you said "this house is my home,
| The living room so fine!
| You're free to wonder and to roam
| But this couch here is mine!'
| But you know I am feline...
| 
| [Chorus]
| My meow is an evil meow! Shed shed shed shed hi!
| My cat box's really swell, but your couch is nearby
| My cat's hair lying in a trail, for this place
| Is the place I would rest my tail!
| My meow is an evil meow! Shed shed shed shed hi!
| 
| I just can't ignore that I'm a Felis Cat-
| -us, though it seems that you forgot
| It's my nurture, it's my nature, if not nomenclature
| I'm the King and you are not!
| 
| And I thought, "we'll call this human 'slave'"
| Why is this a surprise?
| This is how all cats you know behave
| I thought you'd realize.
| It's time for you to recognize...
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| [Bridge]
| This couch is really great, thanks a bunch
| It's time to celebrate -- won't you get my lunch?
| I'm pretty sure you knew cats when you brought me in the door
| Bearing that firmly in mind, what'd you think you were needed for?
| I'm hungry, and I need to eat! [Dumb dumb]
| So now go and bring me some meat! [Yum yum!]
| My meow is an evil meow. Shed shed, NOM NOM, hi!
| 
| Please don't be offended, it's not what I intended,
| Though I don't care if you are
| I won't get any thinner -- you'll be giving me dinner
| I'll go lounge on your bar
| 
| Because, hey, this house is mine alone!
| I rule all I survey!
| That's cats -- they're kings right to the bone
| It's always been the way
| There's just one more thing to say:
| 
| [Chorus]
