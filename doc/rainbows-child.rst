Rainbow's Child
---------------

| TTTO "Yalduti Hashnia" by Mati Caspi
| 
| [Chorus]
| I am a child once again,
| Though I was old, and quite ill
| I am a child once again,
| A thrill
| I am a child once again,
| Future has happend, not "will"
| I am a child once again,
| Old man, yes, still
| 
| In a new world, these eyes
| Are processing these wonders I see
| What is now truth and what lies?
| Future that I had not forseen
| My speech is full of sighs
| When once it was subtle with words
| I'm learning to live in this world --
| A plot slowly is unfurled
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Poems I read with these eyes,
| Of birth and of death I have wrote
| I will now cheat for the prize
| To write once again, and to gloat
| I am now full of despise
| For all my colleagues in school
| What reason is there to live?
| My crimes nobody forgives
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Seeing through better eyes
| A world that's of magic full
| Though now I should be so wise
| I can hardly resist the pull
| Though I've been used by spies
| Still not a day do I regret
| For this time, is a gift, this I know
| I have now once again where to go
| 
| [Chorus]
