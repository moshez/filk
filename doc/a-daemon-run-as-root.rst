A Daemon Run As Root

| I wrote this one about 5 years ago, and only found it now.

| <pre>Chorus:  I spawn for the lost and killed children
|          I wait for that silent SIG Child
| 	 And if only you would have capabilities
| 	 You would not have a daemon run as root
| 
| The os of the computer has been brought up, has been started
| And the unborn children wait for me to start
| I must first initialize my memory and open files
| And only then can I call fork() a lot
| 
| You broke into the children with some overflowing buffers
| And the reading children died as I stood by
| What kind of heartless crackers would kill children without even tears
| They want to get a daemon who runs as root
| 
| I've tried with all my failing strength to spawn more or to spawn less
| But I cannot put a block on the IP
| And as you stage this distributed denial of service attack
| I take down the computer as I fall</pre>
