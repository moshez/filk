| 
| The morning's came, the car had gas
| The GPS was ready
| I've punched the destination in
| My driving hands were steady
| 
| I had to try hard not to speed
| For tickets I had just no need
| I copied from a car its style
| I followed it for miles and miles
| 
| [Chorus]
| Hey Yo Yah
| Policeman's here
| Hey Yo Yah
| I'll have to pray
| Hey Yo Yah
| It's not my year
| Hey Yo Yah
| It's not my day
| 
| The car that I was following
| Had thought I was annoying
| The driver, he had had enough
| With me, he was not toying
| 
| He waved for me to go along
| I figured, I can do no wrong
| I'll speed it up, just for a bit
| But with the radar I was hit
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now officer, please pity me
| Let me off with a warning
| I promise that I will behave
| At least until next morning
| 
| I'll choose the cars to follow well
| Until we reach the gates of hell
| It's creepy, I apologize
| I'm really truly sorry guys
| 
| [Chorus]
