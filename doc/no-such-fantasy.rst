| On a day of wind and rain my daughter said to me:
| "The clouds are full of things today, oh mommy, can you see?"
| "What kind of things?" I asked her as the clouds went rushing by.
| "There's elves and and dwarves and dragons all marching in the sky."
| I took her from the window and I sat her on my knee,
| And I told her "Stop this foolishness and listen well to me..."
| 
| CHORUS:
| 
| There's no such thing as dragons,
| And there's no such thing as elves.
| They're creatures out of fantasy
| Of tales we tell our selves
| 
| But now my daughter's quiet and she spends too long with friends,
| To save a maid from dragons, she'll walk to kingdom's ends
| And I know that one day soon now, when she's old enough to care
| She'll want to take the games outside and LARP in open air
| And she'll learn about the foam swords, and she'll paste on elven ears
| And in spite of all our trying, she will live out our worst fears
| 
| For -- [CHORUS]
