The Scary Vampire Song
----------------------

| TTTO "The Hippotamus Song", by Donald Swann and Michael Flanders
| 
| A scary vampire was standing one night
| On the street, and the night it was dark
| He gaze at the people walk in the light
| 'Till he found a lady to mark
| 
| There 'neath a streetlight, glorious hair
| A sweet little wink of a maid
| That scary vampire, with a look that was dire
| Whispered and quietly preyed:
| 
| [Chorus]
| Blood, blood, such tasty blood,
| Nothing quite like it, I'm telling you bud,
| So follow me, follow, your blood I will swallow
| I'll swish in my mouth, such scrumptious blood
| 
| The scary vampire, no need to entice
| He knew that his dinner was near
| His sire not cared for to give him advice
| Away from this maiden to steer
| 
| Like thunder his ears they picked up the sound
| Of her footsteps, with thin long high heel
| His victim on this night, prepared for a hard fight
| She promised she'd not be a meal
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now the slayer when fighting she jumps and she whirls
| It is hard from those punches to hide
| And though all her kicks are those of a girl
| When they hit you you'll wish you had died
| 
| The vampires have learned, when their pal turned to ash,
| To check well if a girl is their bane
| And all scary vampires, that to long live aspire
| Are careful when singing again:
| 
| [Chorus]
