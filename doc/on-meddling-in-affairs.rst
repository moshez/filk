On Meddling in Affairs
----------------------

| [Chorus]
| Do not meddle in dragon affairs
| That is what they always say
| But offense in artists' lairs
| Has a steeper price to pay
| 
| You should never slight a bard
| For he holds much stronger cards
| See, your name has funny rhymes
| Enshrined 'till end of times
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now a writer don't insult
| For so swift is the result
| In his story you will do
| Dumb things he wants you to
| 
| [Bridge]
| Now remember, if you care,
| About your life, then don't you dare
| Insult someone who's good with words
| It's much worse than offending lords
| 
| [Chorus]
