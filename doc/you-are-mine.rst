You Are Mine
------------

| TTTO "Wildmage" by me, tune by Peter Alway ("Telynor")
| 
| Yes, I do feel dirty parodying my own stuff. But Steve Savtizky said I could!
| 
| Bounties you give to me, cause me to thank
| For I know it is no small a task
| I'll take what's mine, as will befit my rank
| All that you have's mine to ask
| 
| [Chorus]
| You are my larder,
| When full, it is harder
| To stand fast, not fall for your charms
| The food is my dream and to it I am slave
| When close to it I can't behave
| 
| I'll fill you friend, with the food I have bought
| So much that it makes my friends sick
| When I was young, to eat less I was taught
| Now, this old habit I'll kick
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| You are now full, but it won't be for long
| I know I will eat well today
| It feels so good that it just can't be wrong
| I don't care how much I'll weigh
| 
| [Chorus]
