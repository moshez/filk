Deep-Nets are Better Than People
--------------------------------

| <p class="verse">Deep-nets are better than people,
| Al don't you think that's true?</p>
| <p class="verse">Yeah, people will error
| Decide out of terror,
| And play silly moves with no clue</p>
| <p class="verse">But people speak better than deep-nets
| Al, don't you think that I'm right?</p>
| <p class="verse">That's once again true,
| For all that you knew</p>
| <p class="verse">You got me, let's call it a night</p>
| <p class="verse">Good night</p>
| <p class="verse">Don't let the frostbite bite</p>
