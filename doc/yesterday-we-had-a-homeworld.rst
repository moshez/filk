| Yesterday,
| The planet looked as though it's here to stay
| Now I have to go so far away
| Oh, I believe in yesterday.
| 
| Suddenly,
| I was launched into the vacuum sea
| The probability drive just saved me
| Stolen space crafts come suddenly
| 
| Why Trill
| Had to go: Zaphod's heads were not denied
| Now I'm
| On the ship, and I long for yesterday
| 
| Yesterday,
| The humans' planet was just blown away
| By a Vogonite destruction ray
| Oh, I believe in yesterday.

| Oh, I believe in yesterday.
| 
| Terra was a harmless world
