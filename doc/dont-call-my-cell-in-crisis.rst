| Don't call my cell in crisis in the night
| Do not try waking me when outside there is no light
| For when the sun has set I've gone away
| You will not reach me 'till the sun has risen the next day
| 
| Don't call my cell in crisis, I'm asleep
| And waking me from slumber has a price and it is steep
| So try to solve the problems on your own
| For when I sleep I like to do it quite far from my phone
| 
| Don't call my cell in crisis, wait the time
| Until I've slept and woke again -- quite early, let's say nine?
| For when I come to work, and read the mail
| I'll read it and then solve it, it will not have gotten stale
