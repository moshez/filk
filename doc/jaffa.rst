| TTTO "יוסי יוסי" By Yehonathan Gefen
| 
| We have travelled through the Stargate, to all planets far and wide
| We have gathered a companion, in whose belly the gould hides
| Though his name is strange and foreign, we pronounce it just as "Tilk"
| And although he looks so different, we know him to be our ilk
| 
| [Chorus]
| Jaffa, Jaffa, Jaffa, Jaffa, all the worlds will fear you still
| Jaffa, Jaffa, Jaffa-a, for your kind was bred to kill
| 
| When you need to leave the mountain, to this planet's open space
| You can't risk to blow the secret for although you're of our race
| Wear a hat to hide your strangeness, so you'll pass as one of us
| Trying not to draw attention as you wait to board the bus
| 
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Jaffa, Jaffa, Jaffa, Jaffa, oh, this journey is a thrill
| Jaffa, Jaffa, Jaffa-a, signed with love, your friend, O'Neal
