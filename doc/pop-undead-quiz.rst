Pop Undead Quiz

| 
| There are blank white eyes in lectures
| When the professors have burned the sense out of the class
| They may be boring, even frightning
| But when the class is over you can rest up on the grass
| 
| There are blank white eyes in windows, too
| When the zombies stand shoulders to shoulder, they're after our brains
| And they're so earnest, they're so hungry
| As they're breaking the doors down, I feel I cannot stand the strain
| 
| But I am scared, so scared
| Zombies attacking our camp
| I am scared so scared
| As the light goes out in the lamp
| For zombie hords will speak with only one voice:
| It's brains or brains, this isn't multiple choice
| 
| We can't shake the zombies off
| Though it looks exciting, this is really no game
| We can set the woods on fire
| But when the smoke is over, they'll be coming all the same
| 
| Scared, so scared
| They're coming in from all sides
| Scared, so scared
| It is useless to fight off this tide
| Scared, so scared
| For zombie hords will speak with only one voice:
| It's brains or brains, this isn't multiple choice
| 
| It's brains or brains, this isn't multiple choice
