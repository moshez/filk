Love Letter (the Conservative version)
--------------------------------------

| Ben Newman has a lovely song called "Love Letter", which is a metaphor for Progressive Judaism. I could not resist attempting to rewrite it to be about my affiliation -- Conservative Judaism. Here's a version of the last four verses which resonates more closely with my beliefs:
| 
|    Please don't say you expect me to make sense of this vastness
|    For the words are too tricky and so...
|    See, while some of the laws do make sense when I read them
|    There are rules that I still need to know
| 
| I've occasionally heard
| That law doesn't endear
| And that what we have here
| Is a legal dispute
| 
| We both know that's absurd
| But the rules are exacting
| As debate they're attracting
| And I am in pursuit --
| 
|         I just feel that good laws here can still be decided
|         That's why I read the words once again
|         We can talk this thing through, we can learn it anew
|         Learn it over and over -- 'cause I'll love you forever --
|         Each time falling in love with you all over again
