March of McDonald's
-------------------

| TTTO "March of Cambreadth"
| 
| This is all the fault of Blind Leming Chiffon, BTW!
| 
| Customers, now come in
| Offer help, please, with a grin!
| Will you make this one a meal?
| Can't afford to pass that deal
| We will serve as honest drones
| For in here we are all pawns
| Heart disease will make you die --
| How many of them will eat our fries!
| 
| All these burgers, must be sold
| For we trash them when they're old
| Eat until you die or drop
| With that much food it's hard to stop
| Close your minds to stress and pain --
| Eat 'till you're no longer sane
| Let not one fat gram pass by --
| How many of them will eat our fries!
| 
| Guard the credit and cash as well
| With the discounts -- more to sell
| We know well the game, the score
| They will eat here evermore
| Toys we sell are full of lead
| Oops, some kids will end up dead
| But we'll stand right up and lie!
| How many of them will eat our fries!
| 
| French, or freedom -- just a name
| For a food that's full of shame
| Still your bodies pay the toll
| As you eat those portions, whole
| We will serve as honest drones
| For in here we are all pawns
| Heart disease will make you die --
| How many of them will eat our fries!
| 
| [Repeat first verse]
