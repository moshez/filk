Drunk Like a Fish
-----------------

| Tune: original
| 
| Goldfishes swimming in water
| Cannot imagine the slaughter
| On the table with food --
| You know this can't be good
| 
| [Chorus]
| You get drunk if you drink like a fish
| So fish are drunk all the time
| And I bet that some people wish
| They avoided the fish-drinking crimes
| 
| Goldfishes meeting the fandom
| Cannot imagine the freedom
| As they're poured in a glass --
| They are dropped on their ass
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Goldfishes surviving the danger 
| Cannot imagine the stranger
| That has poured them right back --
| Now they won't be a snack
| 
| [Chorus]
