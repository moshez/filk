| I find in the evenings ten times out of ten
| If I smile at him right, I can get any man
| We go somewhere secluded and lie down on the grass
| And we'll fool around and I'll show him my...rank
| I'm a young lady of savvy and charm
| And I've slept with all the young boys on the farm
| Some like it gentle and some like it rough
| I want it all and I can't get enough
| 
| Chorus:
| Flatten the grass, flatten the grass
| It's clear what we're doing to flatten the grass
| Flatten the grass, flatten the grass
| It's clear what we're doing to flatten the grass
| 
| Da says that boys have one thing on their minds
| But he may be in shock, if he only finds
| That I have the same thing on my mind as well
| He'll preach and he'll tell me I'm going to hell
| But I'm not gonna stop, it just feels too damn good
| For a roll in the hay I'm always in the mood
| But I do it discreetly and the clues I mask
| I'll tell him no lies if no questions he'll ask
| 
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Ma says that young ladies have to take care
| So I heed her words and I always prepare
| I make sure to take pills, you can't count on the guy
| If he's after sex then he surely will lie
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now Peter and I will go off and play
| Out in the grass, by night or by day --
| He's no longer mad when I punch him or kick
| For our S&amp;M games are fun, although sick
