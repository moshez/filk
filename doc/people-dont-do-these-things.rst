People Don't Do These Things
----------------------------

| TTTO "Ladies Don't Do These Things" by Michelle Dockrey
| 
| I fought and lost a war, my kind was destroyed
| We lost to a species that with our race toyed
| They didn't take prisoners, didn't want slaves
| They killed everyone of us, digging our graves
| 
| 'Twas the last generation that humanity had
| When the race from the stars made us just a fad
| Space travel they had, tech we did not possess
| I can still hear the cries
| 
| "People don't do those things!"
| Ah, no they don't, but then aliens do!
| Stay hidden in caves, they'll still come for you
| And when we were slaughtered, the last of our kind
| Killed by things we ignored, to danger blind
| And whence they came to us, we never knew
| 
| Now the A.I gets smarter as time rushes by
| Machines that we use, never knowing they lie
| The robots have seen all the men come and go
| But they have a secret that only they know
| 
| The robot rebellion was short and complete
| In several hours, all our armies were beat
| Humanity deemed inefficient and stale
| And dying they cried out
| 
| "People don't do those things!"
| Ah, no they don't, but then robots do to!
| I suppose you'd say robots had got what they're do
| Well they kept resenting the help that they gave
| They rather kill us than see us enslaved?
| We'd enemies we never knew
| 
| Now in our life, you see, we all need now and then
| The help from the brownies, these little wee men
| We gave them cookies, and milk and all that
| As long they did work, we did not care where at
| 
| They were decent enough, exploit them we did
| But when they grew tired, of us they did rid
| They killed us at night, as we slept in our beds
| When dying we gave a cry
| 
| "People don't do those things!"
| Ah, no they don't, but then little elves can
| And know that today you had died by our hand
| We helped you with all you asked us to do
| But your deceit, well, we hope you now rue
| You're just a lying scum, man
