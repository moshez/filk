Synchronized Watches
--------------------

| TTTO "תנו לגדול בשקט" by Aver Kenner and Yoel Lerner
|  
| We have chosen science, we now have a side
| We've all been recruited, try to turn the tide
| Synchronize the watches
| Fight for knowledge shining through
| Light fuse with matches
| Fight brave and true!
| 
| [Chorus]
| Superstition's evil
| Let our science rule
| We cannot stand any more the fools
| Superstiton's evil
| Voodo magic bad
| People who do magic make us sad
| 
| They have chosen magic, they are now our foes
| Lines in sand were marked here, now we trade our blows
| We fight, the stakes here
| Are if technology survives
| For all we hold dear
| And soon we're fighting for lives
| 
| [Chorus]
