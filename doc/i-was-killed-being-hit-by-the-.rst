I Was Killed Being Hit by the "Silmarillion"

| Loosely based on "Questionable Content"
| 
| When I first read the Hobbit, it was short and it was fun
| And I carried it in my pocket all the time
| I couldn't put it down, re-read it when I was done
| My fingers got it full of dirt and grime
| You see, I like it short and sweet
| And if I had to be be beat
| I'd rather it was by this book, but see...
| 
| I was killed being hit by the "Silmarillion"
| Though I tried so very hard to dodge this book
| Was it the genealogical charts?  The poems in ninety two parts?
| Whatever it was, my life it swiftly took
| I was killed being hit by the "Silmarillion"
| It was painful when my head was split in two
| How would she so dare, and I thought she'd come to care
| Oh, baby dear, I didn't know that we were through
| 
| It isn't that I don't appreciate the cause
| But I had a pretty good excuse
| I was drunk -- so overused
| I'll admit I'm to blame here, but I didn't break no laws
| Though "working late" is such a tired ruse
| An affair I had, so what?
| You shouldn't turn into a nut
| But she did, and you know what she had done:
| 
| I was killed being hit by the "Silmarillion"
| Illuvatar's turned out to be the scroned wife's hero
| I need galadriel to whip me up a magic spell
| To bump my heart beat rate to not be zero
| I was killed being hit by the "Silmarillion"
| On her first attempt, she didn't need one after
| I feel for those dark ring lords, for wrong deeds can have rewards
| I would have lived if it had one less chapter
| 
| Her library has got a really fine Tolkien collection
| And her co-worker I slept with's really...deep
| I wanted to impress her with my erudite selection
| And so my wife's found out I'm a creep
| It was no gentle Tolkien tap
| That put me in eternal nap
| And she said, "I know I'm not the only one"
| 
| Who kills by hitting guys with "Silmarillion"
| You want us to forgive but we just can't
| And I think I need not mention, it will be soon a convention (lethal weapon, that)
| So now I'll kill you using the "Silmarillion"
| A thousand boring elves can hit so hard
| Yes I'll kill you using the "Silmarillion"
| And do you know what, yes, I'll tell you what, I'm not ashamed!
