Code in Perl
------------

| TTTO "Brown-Eyed Girl", Van Morrison
| 
| Hey why did you die
| Gone when the files came
| You won't even try
| That is a bit lame
| Stopping and not running, hey hey,
| Skipping bytes and breaking,
| In the dead of night when
| The strings a chompin' and you
| My code in Perl
| You're my code in Perl
| 
| Whatever happened
| This day you ran so slow
| Going down with naught
| No results I can show
| Fixing expressions that match patterns 
| Cursing this guy, Larry Wall
| To insanity sliding
| Soon I know that I will fall, with you
| My code in Perl
| You're my code in Perl
| 
| Do you remember when we used to write,
| Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
| 
| So hard to find a way
| To fix this on my own
| Gonna call some help this fateful day
| My how the bugs have grown
| Lost my memory back there, Lord
| I cannot stand thinking 'bout
| Going out to the green grass
| Thinking no more about you
| My code in Perl
| You're my code in Perl
| 
| Do you remember when we used to write,
| Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
