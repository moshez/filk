Talked With Our Hands
---------------------

| TTTO "Spoke With Our Hands", Echo's Children
| 
| When I was a youngster, our school tried to teach
| That moving your hand's not required for speech
| But from all I could see, it's the way it's done here
| You can see someone's talking without your ears
| 
| [Chorus]
| We talk with our hands, can not do otherwise
| We are rough and direct, we're just plain simple guys
| Don't gesture's a thing that no one understands
| In a country where everyone talks with their hands
| 
| But as much as I did it, I still had my fears
| That doing it this way would end all in tears
| And I couldn't explain, and nobody would care
| Why our gesturing isn't a good thing to share
| 
| [Chorus]
| ...
| ...
| Keep your hand on the wheel, here, no one understands
| In a country where everyone talks with their hands
| 
| I can try to conceal it but still I am caught
| For my gesturing hands I can't stop 'till I rot
| And I hoped it would stop with the wisdom of age
| That I gesture in happiness, sadness or rage
| 
| [Chorus]
| ...
| ...
| Talking and Wii-ing, no one understands
| In a country where everyone talks with their hands
| 
| I talk with my hands, as I did so before
| To gesture when talking is deep in my core
| Though I'm far from my country, I'm doing it still
| Earth be my witness -- I meant you no ill
| 
| [Chorus]
| ...
| ...
| In hand-cuffs, and speaking? No one understands
| In a country where everyone talks with their hands
