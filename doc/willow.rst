Willow
------

| OMG! I found some of my ooooold Buffy filks. Posting them for posterity.
| 
| TTTO "Lola"
| 
| I met her in a highschool in Sunnydale
| Where the vampires eat the postmen so that you never ever get mail
| Mail in Sunnydale, no chance
| I saw the little runt sitting there on a bench
| When I asked her name and in a quiet voice she said "Willow"
| Wi-wi-wi-wi-Willow
| Wi-wi-wi-wi-Willow
| 
| Well, I've been around, but I ain't ever seen
| A girl who look like a a geek but a witch since she was teen
| Oh, my Willow
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
| How she does those spells just by waving her hand
| Oh, my Willow
| Wi Wi wi wi Willow
| 
| Well, I left home just a week before
| And I've never ever seen a vampire before
| But Buffy Summers, she staked the vamp, like that
| But when it comes to magic, Willow is the best bet
| Well, I was amazed with what I've just seen
| And I sure hope Willow will never get mean
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| So she became veiny black
| This wasn't a fake
| She even killed Rake
| Well, she almost lost her head
| But I won't forget what Xander said
| 
| He said, "Will, stay away from the darker side
| And if you start to go astray, let the crayon be your guide"
| Oh, my Willow
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| "I know what Warren did was really rough
| "But remember that you killed him, and that is enough"
| Oh, my Willow
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| 
| Then she heard her friends really got in a mess
| So she's gonna have to leave Giles, I guess
| How not to be evil, she almost knows
| And if she can't wing it then the whole world goes
| Now she even got past Amy's spell
| The kiss got her past her personal hell
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
| Wi wi wi wi Willow
