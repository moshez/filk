The Page After Last
-------------------

| TTTO Brooke Lunderville's "The Last Page"
| 
| I finished your book and
| I don't like the real world
| Your world, seems to me, is more true
| 
| The writing was great,
| And the reader was willing
| And until the fat lady has sung --
| T'ain't over
| 
| [Chorus]
| I just want to be there again -- only this time
| With my love, to spare heroes some pain
| To write of your magic, to make heroes villains
| As through cannon I happily romp
| 
| I stare at that last page and
| Close my eyes briefly and
| The key for the music is there
| 
| Before it is over
| The lyrics I must share 
| As it fits the score
| That I planned
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I have the dwarf gently
| Fall in love with the elf
| As they play such a wonderful game
| 
| There's only one cure
| For their feelings of love
| Start a new fic and
| Keep writing
| 
| [Chorus]
| So I romp
