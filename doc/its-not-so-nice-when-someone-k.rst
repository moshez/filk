It's Not So Nice When Someone Kills Your Song
---------------------------------------------

| TTTO Brooke Lunderville's "It's Just So Nice When Someone Knows Your Name"
| 
| I'd like like to be a singer on the radio or TV
| It's kinda nice to get some well deserved publicity
| I could get arrested for doing something bad
| Like hitting some young idiot who really got me mad
| 
| It's not so nice when someone kills your song
| When they molest the tunes you wrote
| This kind of stuff, it gets my goat
| See, it's not nice when someone kills your song
| 
| I'd like to write a song that filker friends will hum along
| And they would all enjoy it so they'll want to write a new song 
| We filkers like a challenge, we want to feel so deep
| This parody's so obvious, I wrote it in my sleep
| 
| It's not so nice when someone kills your song
| When people twist the words around
| 'till the original can't be found
| See, it's not nice when someone kills your song
| 
| I'd like for Weird Al Yankovich a parody to write
| So I can hear the parody on radio in the night
| And frat boys whose fine motor skills have been dissolved by beer
| Would find it quite the clever bit, when it gets in their ear
| 
| It's not so nice when someone kills your song
| And people sing the parodies
| To nice and bouncy melodies
| See, it's not nice when someone kills your song
| 
| I'd like for big name filkers to make hash out of my stuff
| It would be such a comfort, for such fame, it is enough
| For some days you've got talent, and some days your stuff sucks so
| But you can never go wrong with such a parody deluxe-o
| 
| It's just so nice when someone kills your song
| And you've got everlasting fame
| "Kanef got me" you can proclaim
| I mean, it's nice when someone kills your song
