Pins and Needles
----------------

| TTTO "Ones and Zeroes", Kathy Mar
| 
| The knitters have invaded, they're everywhere you look
| And every conversation is a knitting pattern book
| They rant about the wool they bought, they talk of the "increase"
| I want to find some way to say for me it is Chinese!
| 
| [Chorus]
| Calm down, it's only pins and needles,
| Calm down, it's only yarn and wool
| Calm down, and speak to me in English
| Please realize that when it comes to knitting, I'm a fool
| 
| They sit around for hours as I'm sure you've seen and heard,
| But only other knitters understand a single word
| With stitches, rows and colums, and of patterns they do brag
| The lady that you're talking to has needles in her bag!
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The knitter faction's growing, the day may be at hand
| When everyone must lurn to knit by government command!
| I do not think I'll mind it, I've not minded the reverse
| 'Cause making wools from sweater is a thing that I rehearsed
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| One day I'll learn to knit, but I still doubt I'll do it well
| It won't be that amazing and I don't think it will sell
| Though it might take a lifetime I intend to see it through
| I want to be a part of this exclusive in-crowd too!
| 
| [Chorus]
| Calm down, it's only pins and needles,
| Calm down, it's only yarn and wool
| Calm down, and speak to me in English
| I understand that knitting is a hobby that must rule
| I know that in this day and age, it's now considered cool
| Please realize that when it comes to knitting, I'm a fool
