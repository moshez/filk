Uncle Ben
---------

| TTTO "Arthur Curry" by Ookla the Mok
| 
| Jean Grey, was a phoenix dark, she died and then came back
| And Superman, well he died in the comics, but not long the world him lacked
| All the other characters in comic books
| If they die, they come back later, it's a standard track
| But I know that there won't come a day
| I'm not coming back, no how, no way
| 
| [Chorus]
| I am uncle Ben, power and responsibility
| May be nothing to you, but I think that they correlate you see
| Now please let me reassure you, I am dead and in the ground
| I am uncle Ben, and you better not mess around
| 
| There are days, I swear, I'd whip Peter raw
| The proportionate brain of a T. rex too small
| But I can't, in heaven, here I'm stuck
| I have to trust that he'll make right calls
| 
| Colossus, gave up his life, but Joss wanted him too bad
| It seems like everybody else has died, but as much as I tried
| I'm not going to live, it's all so sad
| Green Arrow has died, but he didn't remain so
| But when goodbye I had said, well forever I did go
| I'm not as tough as Batman, was killed by a gun
| The fault was not all Peter, who I loved as my own sun
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Peter wouldn't be the same, if he didn't feel like he's to blame
| Like he, and not the crook, had took my life
| Even my wife aunt may, says that he is not to blame, he's a good boy now
| But he has a life of sorrow and strife
| 
| Bucky, the Captain's friend, has come back from the dead
| Jason Todd was soon to join him, and has left me all alone here
| But of life back on earth I so dread
| So not me, I guess, I'll stay right here
| I'll sit here up in heaven and I'll drink my beer
| It's tough to live on earth and you know I'm no fool
| With death that's permanent now, I guess that I am cool
| 
| [Chorus]
