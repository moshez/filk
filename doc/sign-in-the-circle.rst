Sign in the circle
------------------

| TTTO of "Dance in the Circle" by Heather Alexander, though it's really based on "Sing in the Circle" by Bob Kanefsky
| 
| I wrote it about Judie Miller, who does ASL interpretation of most of Consonance. It sounds weird, but it is a wonderful experience.
| 
| Here at the con there much more than just sound
| You'll find, if you sing here too long
| There's a person who's moving and jumping around
| And she's making much better the song
| 
| If you see her, you're in for a treat now
| If she's on the stage and she's signing up there
| If you do, then you won't quite know how
| She does it, though she does with flair
| 
| Chorus:
| So please come, join, sign in the circle
| The voices are not quite enough
| Won't you come, join, sign in the circle
| We know that it has to be tough
| 
| She's sign ASL and some improvizations
| She'll keep up with all the fast tunes
| And just to match up all the creations
| She makes up her own special runes
| 
| (Chorus)
| 
| If you're like me, I know you will be
| Amazed at this genius of course,
| My eyes are glued! Look here dude! She is doing a "horse"!
| Big blue seas! Rockets' breeze ! And all of these things, that
| can't just have signs
| I am in awe! There's no flaw! She's just right on the lines
| La da da, da, da ...
| 
| But she is so great! She will stand and sign straight
| 'Till the con is quite nearing the end
| And sadly I fear, I must wait a whole year
| Before I can see her again
| In the bidding you, you see, a video was sold
| The bidding was too high for me
| And so I'm afraid, when it's all done and told
| I'm afraid, I won't have that DVD
| 
| (Chorus)
