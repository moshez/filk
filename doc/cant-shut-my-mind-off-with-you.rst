Can't Shut My Mind Off With You
-------------------------------

| TTTO "Can't Take My Eyes Off of You", Frankie Vallie

| You're like a bool that is true
| Can't shut my mind off with you
| To all my bugs you're the patch
| And all my patterns you match
| I want to read your disk drive
| All your smooth curves to derive
| You're like a bool that is true
| Can't shut my mind off with you
| 
| Errors are all that I fare
| When stuff with you I compare
| You are beyond all my specs
| Our love is something complex
| But now I know what's the deal
| And I guess that you can't be real
| You're like a bool that is true
| Can't shut my mind off with you
| 
| We're interfacing
| And we're exchanging bytes
| We're interfacing
| You're sending me invites
| Oh, interfacing
| You make sure in I'm in sync
| Oh, interfacing
| You show me lights that blink
| Oh, interfacing
| A list with double links
| Let us interface now
| Let us interface
