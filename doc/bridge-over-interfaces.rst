Bridge Over Interfaces
----------------------

| TTTO "Bridge Over Troubled Water" by Simon&amp;Garfunkel
| 
| When the network's setup wrong
| When packets drop on the floor, I will be along;
| I'm on both sides, moving packets through
| The subnet is now bound
| Like a bridge over interfaces
| Passing packets through
| Like a bridge over interfaces
| Passing packets through
| 
| Router's down and out
| Router's beat
| Routing is so very hard
| Moving packets through
| I'll do this part
| When packets come
| And drops are all around
| Like a bridge over interfaces
| Passing packets through
| Like a bridge over interfaces
| Passing packets through
| 
| Move on, TCP
| Move on through
| The time to live is now
| And you know you're on your way
| You're now so clear
| If you need a MAC
| I will make one appear
| Like a bridge over interfaces
| Passing packets through
| Like a bridge over interfaces
| Passing packets through
