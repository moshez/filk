Fairness
--------

| TTTO "French Prince of Bell-Air"
| 
| Now this a story all about how
| My life got flipped-turned upside down
| And I liked to take a minute
| Just sit right there
| I'll tell you how I became a commie and cared about fair
| 
| In North California, born and raised
| On the whole foods was where I spent most of my days
| Doing my taxin', relaxin' all cool
| As a responsible hippy, not being a fool
| When a couple of guys who were doin' some good
| Trying to help the people in the neigborhood
| Tried to do what's right
| And my mom got scared
| She said, "I have to make you stop carin' 'bout 'fair'"
| 
| And so I left home, joined a commune that was near
| My path never shone neither brighter nor clearer
| If anything, I can say that these guys were rare
| And I thought, "Oh I finally made it, they care about fair"
| 
| I protested, got arrested, seven times -- maybe eight
| And I yelled to the coppers, "go home, people-haters"
| I looked at my life
| Happy I can now care
| About the rights of the people, and just what's good and fair
