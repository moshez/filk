| Times were good two thousand years ago
| It's obvious, just take a look
| Everybody was a poet
| Although most couldn't read books
| Well it's been a long time since ancient Rome
| But look around and you can see it plain
| Though most are in decline we are just doing fine
| And we're whistling a new refrain:
| 
| Refrain:
| Yes these are wonderful times that we live in
| Though society does not like our ilk
| Children have some independence
| And we are all writing filk
| 
| Writing songs used to take a lot of work;
| But parodies are a snap
| You just change some words and it's over
| Though a lot of the time it is crap
| Kanef has come along showed how to write a song
| It is important to conserve more then one song a tune can serve
| And ninety-nine percent of them do
| 
| So now we're going to a new filk con
| And everyone will sing what they please
| It may be off key and off meter
| Not everyone can be performance wiz
| Some come all you need is some lyrics
| And a tune to serve as your base
| If it's popular at all we'll sing and have a ball
| We have fun and just don't care if you're singing like a bear
| So stay until the dawn I don't think you'll be alone
| And we'll sing 'till we're blue in the face
