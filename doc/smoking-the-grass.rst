Smoking the Grass
-----------------

| TTTO "Flatten the Grass", Echo's Children
| 
| I find in the evenings three times out of ten
| I need to relax and let steam off my brain
| I smoke me some weed and my mind seems to clear
| And though it's illegal, it's safer than beer
| Now I'm a felon, though I did no harm
| The world is messed up if it causes alarm
| Repeat propaganda again and again
| It still won't convince me to cease and abstain
| 
| [Chorus]
| Smoking the grass, smoking the grass
| There is no reason to not smoke the grass
| Smoking the grass, smoking the grass
| There is no reason to not smoke the grass
| 
| Drug propaganda has started the war
| Watch all the death and observe all the gore
| This policy looks like it's all out of whack
| It must be derailed and then thrown off its track
| But we aren't square and we don't fit the mold
| Spirits are free, we don't do  what we're told
| But we are not dangerous, I should remark
| Why do they want us all locked in the dark?
| 
| Teachers all say "on drugs don't take a chance"
| I barely look up as I spare them a glance
| "This is your mind" no attention I've paid
| It is just a cartoon meant to make  us afraid
| They are being robots, just saying their lines
| And I can't really stand to hear more of their whines
| Real facts they will not bring, or I would concede
| Until they do that though, I'll keep smoking weed
| 
| Peterkin told me he's got on the side
| Some stuff guaranteed for a wonderful ride
| I tried dropping acid while high on the grass
| Learned some cool things that you won't see in class
| The people who keep on just harping like crows
| A mind that is open, they wish it would close
| I think this is stupid, and I hope somehow
| They'll stop with the laws that the grass disallow
