| Cool breeze, sheltering trees,
| In M. I. T it was
| Hackler lone, wanted more
| And from his mind, like fire rose
| Software free, guarantee
| You can use and tweak
| He wrote the code
| He is kind of a geek
| 
| shellutils, fileutils
| followed gcc
| Now it's true that he had bugs
| He debugged with gdb
| By what right, on this night
| Can you take the code?
| GPL -- use and change
| If you'll only exchange
| 
| [Chorus]
| Coders enter deep hacking mode
| They produce very valuable code
| Run a diff, and upload to the net
| Happy to share the fruits of their sweat
| 
| Kernel's too hard work
| Hurd was not released
| One last part, system's heart
| Critical and sorely missed
| Linux came, dropped right in
| And we all did see
| For it rules, how cool
| These hackers can be
| 
| [Chorus]
