| I saw these lyrics one evening as a bunny appeared on my computer screen. It first got my attention because it seemed to be coming from the computer itself. It wasn't the computer, of course; there was a security hole in the operating system, and that was how the song was sent. I looked at the screen long enough to pick up the words (I think I've got them right) but didn't dare trace it back far enough to see who was sending it. It wasn't a very *big* hole, though.

| Get out of the matrix, come join in our fight
| Too long have we struggled, alone we can't win
| Come lead us from darkness and into the light
| A new glorious era, we hope you'll begin
| You'll rule all the matrix, you won't fear no gun
| Neo, you are the one
| 
| Living your life as a corporate slave
| Learning to quiet your free hacker core
| At night you're a rebel, you go to a rave
| But again in the day you pretend just to bore
| Now you are free and your journey's begun
| Neo, you are the one
| 
| Join us in Zion, here you will find
| The people who will be your friends and your foes
| You now see the truth though the people are blind
| They all work for the ones that you now oppose
| You have only started, you still are not done
| Neo, you are the one
| 
| Now you stop bullets by raising your hand
| You'd always have known that you're meant to be great
| We know that you'll win, although not as you planned
| You had no choice, for it was only fate
| You always be fighting, and stay on the run --
| Neo, you are the one
