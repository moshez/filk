| Note the first: The original has like a gazillion verses. I tried to keep the spirit, but to make something a bit
| shorter.
| 
| Note the second: loosely based on "Sleeper" (S7) and "Lie To Me" (S2)

| Early one evening just as sun was setting
| I saw a vampire drinking a maid
| "Oh, won't you turn me, desire -- it burns me
| Please give me these things for which I have prayed"
| 
| Remember the time when you were but a mortal
| Remember the gift which was given to you
| You must keep giving, sire the worthy
| No more you will walk alone in the night
| 
| Here now I wander alone as I wonder
| The magic that your kind can see in the night
| The teeth that bite so deep, oh how they pain me
| Never will I see the sun's morning light
| 
| Thus sung the maiden, for her it is over
| She is now doomed -- with her life she has paid
| Oh, she has turned now, oh, but she knows how
| She has gotten all for which she has prayed
