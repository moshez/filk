The Perfect One
---------------

| No tune yet.
| 
| Some call her old, well she's mature
| She was my first and oldest mate
| She's wonderful though quite obscure
| But she is not my fate
| 
| [Chorus]
| It's hard to find the perfect one
| Until your journey's done
| I will not stop, I will not rest
| Until I find who is the best
| 
| The young one, bubbling, spirits high
| Was strictly "just for here and now"
| She's not my girl, I'm not her guy
| And so I said goodbye
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The one for me, the one I chose
| She is a techy hippy geek
| She's always frank, with little pose
| Though some will call her freak
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| (It's a metaphor. It talks about living in places.)
