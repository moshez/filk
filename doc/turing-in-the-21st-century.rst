| Times were bad fifty years ago
| Said Turing: "if a look you'll just take
| The machines don't halt when we tell them
| And a human being they cannot fake"
| Well it's been a long time since Turing
| But look around, it's gotten worse
| The computers still won't halt it's not the programmers at fault
| And we're singing a similar verse:
| 
| Refrain:
| Yes these are terrible times that we live in,
| Society is going to explode
| Computers don't obey their masters
| And everyone is writing code
| 
| Once assembler used to take a lot of work
| But high-level makes it a snap
| You just create a dozen objects
| Although the performance is crap
| The algorithm doesn't have to be clever
| Or original or not trash;
| If it runs occasionally that's ok for you and me
| And strings you'd not expect your program won't reject
| And ninety-nine percent of them crash
| 
| [Refrain]
| 
| So now we're living in a Turing dream
| Computing resources are cheap
| But the window system consumes them
| And the features continue to creep
| So come on all you need is Python
| And motivation to scratch your itch
| If the computer won't obey you will make it run your way
| Just write a script or two and run it on gentoo
| And if you use the GPL then your code won't go to hell
| And you will be a programming witch
| 
| [Refrain]
