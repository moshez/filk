Operation: Bug storm
--------------------

| TTTO Tom Smith's "Operation: Desert Storm"
| 
| The coffe's burning and black when it's poured in the cup
| My gut is churning as this is the tenth I drink up
| Nothing to do, but to drink this, or else I will sleep
| I can't afford that, or go home, in this I'm stuck deep
| 
| The bugs that I have must be fixed ere release
| Before they are solved I will not have much peace
| I'll get that thing to work if this is the last thing I do
| 
| If Murphy's Laws are religion, I must be a saint.
| For every pointer that's good, well, it suddenly ain't
| A thousand errors and warnings in every compile
| And as I see this I find I must choke down some bile
| 
| From off-by-one-errors to bugs in design
| There must be an error in each second line
| I'll get that thing to work if this is the last thing I do
| 
| The hours go by, the clock says that it's almost two
| And by tommorow, I think that the deadline is due
| Got little time left, the code still is far off from done
| My work's not ended, my God, it is hardly begun
| 
| But my super genius will fix all that crap,
| And all that I need is avoiding a nap
| And I'll get it working -- perhaps I should try something new.
| 
| My debugger crashed, and I'm left with only my screams
| My printing of logs worked just fine, until I mixed the streams
| My screen had blue death, it was weird, I'm not using MS
| My hard drive is filled with the files that I wrote from this mess
| 
| But I'm smarter, I'm stronger, it's just a machine
| Why does it insist not to do what I mean
| And I'll get that thing to work if it's the last thing I do!
| 
| .... Eureka! That's it!
| I SHOULD USE LISP!
