Duty Bound
----------

| TTTO "Mi Yada Sh'Kakh Yihyeh" by Uzi Hitman
| 
| You are the one
| This duty you can't shun
| Chosen our hero please save us all
| Though you look fragile and so small
| 
| Hard to leave what you know
| Leaving all you had behind
| Where will you now go?
| What will you come to find
| 
| Who could know you'd be so tough
| A slayer with mystical powers
| You had saved the world more than enough
| From things that kill and devour
| 
| Who could know you'd be so tough
| A slayer with mystical powers
| You had saved the world more than enough
| From things that kill and devour
| 
| You are the one
| This duty you can't shun
| Chosen our hero please save us all
| Though you look fragile and so small
| 
| You think that you know
| Innocence you'd left behind
| Who's friend and who's foe?
| You'll come to feel so blind
| 
| Who could know you'd be so tough
| A slayer with mystical powers
| You cannot ever say "enough"
| You cannot hide and cower
| 
| You are the one
| This duty you can't shun
| Chosen our hero please save us all
| Though you look fragile and so small
| 
| All that you now know
| Mysteries were left behind
| You now have to grow
| You are no longer confined
| 
| Who could know you'd be so tough
| A slayer who has her good buddies
| Even when life has gotten rough
| With whom to share fights and studies
