"Eaten by Zombies" is Good
--------------------------

| TTTO Tom Smith's "Kidnapped by Pirates" is Good
| 
| Sometimes life isn't all it might be
| Sometimes it's boring and pale
| The same old routine, played out daily
| And you wonder if you'd gone stale
| 
| Well, I can't offer solutions
| When on your parade it now rains
| But being offed, well, if you must
| By a creature who likes to say "brains"
| 
| And it's oh no, off we go
| We'll run from the undead
| Faster now, and far away
| Lest a plate is made of our heads
| I'm feeling so much scared now
| Zombies' table manners are rude
| So I'm running for all I'm worth now, friends
| "Eaten by zombies is good"
| 
| A zombie is looking fer brains my dear,
| Gray cells are moist and sweet
| He certainly eats it with pleasure my dear
| To him, you're all made out of meat
| 
| He don't need no fancy cutlery
| To pick apart at your brain
| A crowbar to bash, there's really no rush
| Pretty soon you'll stop feeling pain
| 
| And it's oh no, off we go
| The zombies are right here
| Way hay, close now by
| And what we're feeling is sheer --
| So much of this fright, more than even
| Steven King had thought we would
| Ah, the living, that's right, we're not leaving
| "Eaten by zombies is good"
| 
| Now, "Murdered by pirates is good", they said,
| In the film The Princess Bride
| But we find much more scary
| If by zombies hands we died
| 
| There ain't no reason why now our life
| Has to fade to black
| So let's stop all our breathing
| New brains will be our snack
| 
| So let me eat your brain right now
| I promise I'll be quick
| And then you'll be a zombie too
| Now don't you call me sick
| 
| We'll go eating brains with relish
| Though some people think it's obscene
| And tomorrow we will take over
| We'll zombie king and queen
| 
| And it's oh no, off we go,
| We are no fantasy
| Way hay, far away,
| Where more brains ought to be
| And every night I love it more than
| I ever thought I could
| In the dead of night, they're running scared
| "Eaten by zombies" is good.
| And we'll take over all of humanity
| "Eaten by zombies" is good!
