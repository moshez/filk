Eating Some More Brain
----------------------

| TTTO "Singing in the Rain", Gene Kelley
| 
| I'm eating some more brain
| Just eating some more brain
| What a glorious feasting
| And I'm famished again
| I'm shambling at crowds
| Their fear is so sweet
| The death's in my heart
| And I'm ready to eat
| 
| If the heroes now chase
| The undead from this place
| I don't care, I'll eat brain
| While I'm hiding my face
| I'll limp down the lane
| With a scary refrain
| Just eating, and munching on a brain
