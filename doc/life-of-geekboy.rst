Life of Geekboy
---------------

| TTTO "Bride of Wolfman", Ookla the Mok
| 
| Even a man who's raised with love
| And sleeps well every night
| May become a geek when he learns of Trek
| When the dialogue he'll recite
| 
| People tell me that I'm insane yeah
| Just because I got that mono-mania
| My hobbies, by some people, are maligned
| When you're a geekboy it gets kind of lonely
| And though I know I'm not the only one
| There comes a time when you have to decide
| Need to decide
| 
| And I cannot cook no food that's worth a damn
| I'm eating it right from the can -- my spam
| But I'm telling you it is that bad
| And before I get kicked out by dad
| Frustration with the basement I am rife
| I want a life
| 
| I want a job man that's plan to see
| But I think that you will not disagree
| That my outfit will need some redesign
| People told me I should stop to skip
| The showers -- man that was really a good tip
| And now I look and smell top-of-the line
| Oh, I smell fine!
| 
| From the basement I have been cut by a knife
| I'm a geekboy, I can never have a life
| 
| But though I really really tried
| And I have waited for a sign
| I still watch Star Trek when I'm on my own
| 
| And I can't fool you, you can see
| As soon as you will glance at me
| That I am just a geekboy in your eyes
| I'm still a geek who likes Trek deep inside
| That is still what I do for fun
| And this is what I'll teach to my son
| And you won't pry
| Trek from my fingers, 'till I will lose my soul
| 
| I can never be the one you think's right
| I can never be the one you'll talk to in the daytime light
| I can only be the one who'll teach you how in Star Trek's truth is found
| But I'm still alive
| Reach for the skies!
| 
| And you'll be coming with to the moon
| For to space we will go real soon
| I think you'll agree
| That my hobbies I'll no longer hide
