To Space
--------

| TTTO "Go West"
| 
| (Together) We will go away
| (Together) We will go this day
| (Together) With the rockets' roar
| (Together) We will go explore
| 
| (Together) We will fly so high
| (Together) Tell the earth goodbye
| (Together) We will start anew
| (Together) This is what we'll do
| 
| (To Space) Life is so quiet there
| (To Space) We won't have to fight air
| (To Space) Where the sky is black
| (To Space) Not a thing we'll lack
| 
| (To Space, this is what we're gonna do, To Space)
| 
| (Together) We will love the stars
| (Together) We will go to Mars
| (Together) Live and die in space
| (Together) The frontier we'll face
| 
| (I love you) I know you love me
| (I want you) How could I disagree?
| (So that's why) I make no protest
| (When you say) You will do the rest
| 
| (To Space) Life is so quiet there
| (To Space) We won't have to fight air
| (To Space) Where the sky is black
| (To Space) Not a thing we'll lack
| 
| (To Space) Sun throughout the year
| (To Space) We'll live and prosper here
| (To Space) Where the sky is black
| (To Space) Not a thing we'll lack
| 
| There where the air's not free
| We'll be (We'll be) what we want to be (Aah aah aah aah)
| Now if we make a stand (Aah)
| We'll find (We'll find) our promised land (Aah)
| 
| (I know that) There are many ways
| (To live there) Where the stars will blaze
| (Together) We will find a place
| (To settle) In the dark of space
| 
| (Without rush) And the pace back home
| (The hustling) Rustling up a dome
| (I know I'm) Ready to plants to grow
| (So that's where) We are gonna go
| 
| (Where we're gonna go is
| To Space) Life is so quiet there
| (To Space) We won't have to fight air
| (To Space) Where the sky is black
| (To Space) Not a thing we'll lack
| 
| (Life is so quiet there)
| To Space (We won't have to fight air)
| To Space (Where the sky is black)
| To Space (Not a thing we'll lack)
| 
| Come on, come on, come on, come on
| 
| (To Space) Sun throughout the year
| (To Space) We'll live and prosper here
| (To Space) Where the sky is black
| (To Space) Not a thing we'll lack
| 
| (Come on, come on, come on)
| (To Space)
| 
| (To Space)
| (Go, ooh, go, yeah)
| (To Space)
| (Go, ooh, go, yeah)
| (To Space)
| (Go, ooh, go, yeah)
| (To Space)
| (Go, ooh, go, yeah)
| (Gimme a feelin')
| (Gimme a feelin')
| (To Space)
| (Gimme a feelin')
| (Gimme a feelin')
| (To Space)
| (Gimme a feelin')
| (Gimme a feelin')
