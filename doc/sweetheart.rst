Sweetheart

| TTTO "Perakh" by Gidi Gov
| 
| My very own mother's telling me
| Not all our choices can be free
| She is now getting worried, dear
| And for me she is shedding tear
| 
| Why did I go so far away
| Why is the price so high to pay
| I tell her "mommey, there's no choice"
| Her smile, every day, is my rejoyce
| 
| [Chorus]
| Sweet, lovely, awesome, sweetheart
| It is not the black arts
| You are my one and only
| So please don't leave me lonely
| There really is no need to shout and to yell
| Whenever I see you I hear the wedding bells
| 
| I cannot think of nought but us
| So ask not why I do make a fuss
| I know I am strange, this Earth is weird
| But I thought all issues had been cleared
| 
| Come, do not tell me "no" no more
| Open a pathway, gateway, door
| You'll stand beside me, dressed in white
| Please have no fear, it'll be all right
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Back on my planet, saw your smile
| Melted my heart, all twenty tiles
| A new human body, used force-grow,
| Mind uploaded, now watch me go!
| 
| Please do not tell me "it's not real"
| I know the price, I made the deal
| I became human just for you
| Let's be together just us two
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Sweet, lovely, awesome, sweetheart
| It is not the black arts
| Sweet, lovely, awesome, sweetheart
