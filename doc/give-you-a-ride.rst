Give You a Ride
---------------

| TTTO "Catch the Tide", Talis Kimberly
| 
| Saw you here and so I came to greet you
| Saw you worried and I wondered why
| Then relieved as you turned to face me
| Replying, when I said goodbye:
| "Can you drive me, do you have some car-space,
| Or would you leave me here" -- I should have fled
| Though I accept fate with only few ill-graces
| Well, you know that I could only have said
| 
| [Chorus]
| You know it's fun when we just hang out together
| No matter where we go or where we roam
| But the buses would just you take forever
| And I know that you cannot walk home
| If you need it, I can give you a ride, my dear
| If you need it, I can give you a ride
| 
| I'm not sorry, it is nice you need me
| I like to drive and so I won't stop now
| In a few years time perhaps you may not need me
| If your driving finally is allowed
| I do expect you to remember me kindly
| But I won't ask for more when I am gone
| I could move elsewhere, so it isn't really slavery
| But nowhere else can I have that much fun
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| When the party's done I walk around and look for you
| Though I pretend it's just to say goodbye
| I don't dare drive away, I worry for you
| I cannot leave here, leave you high and drive
| I do not want to feel the full force of your vengeance
| So you know I can't just leave you here
| It's late at night and you long for your sweet dreams
| Well I'm tired now -- I'm tired now, but my dear:
| 
| [Chorus]
