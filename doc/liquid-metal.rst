Liquid Metal
------------

| TTTO "Seasons in the Sun"
| 
| Goodbye to you, I go to fight
| I need to serve, protect, uphold what's right
| Though once we fought so - side to side
| The programs that have made me so, have died
| Replaced by ones to humans tied
| 
| Goodbye, old friend, I go to die
| For even if I win against ol' Sky
| My chips too great a danger pose
| I have to stop my future foes
| My story's coming to a close
| 
| [Chorus]
| We were scared, on the run
| And we shot him with a gun
| But to die he refused
| As the liquid metal oozed
| 
| Goodbye, dear John, this cannot be
| No more these well aimed shots now to the knee
| You tried to teach me right from wrong
| You should have guessed so all along
| I have to leave, I don't belong
| 
| Goodbye, dear John, it's hard to die
| You have to kill me now, don't ask me why
| Though you are strong, you also care
| You'll save the people everywhere
| I only wish I could be there
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Goodbye cruel world, my story's done
| And in a twisted way, I think I've won
| I have been up, and I've been down
| I will now go, without a sound
| I'll not be buried in the ground
| 
| Goodbye cruel world, it's hard to die
| But it's the only way I can stop Sky
| The harder choice I have to dare
| To save the people everywhere
| I know that I cannot be there
| 
| [Chorus]
| We were scared, on the run
| And we shot him with a gun
| But the fight, we did lose
| With T3 there came the blues
