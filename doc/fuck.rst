| TTTO "Companion" by Vixy &amp; Tony, from "Thirteen"
| 
| One upon a time, there was an ordinary word
| Narrow little mindsets with a narrow view to hold
| They feared it, and misunderstood
| So they made a law that night, took it from us for good
| You can feel the burning of the books
| You can feel the whispers, the dirty little looks
| My life will never be the same
| Since that stupid law from fascists came
| 
| When we made a crime of that word (Crime of thought and crime of speech)
| When we made a crime of that word (As stupid values they all preach)
| When we made a crime of that word (Narrow minds and vanity)
| When we made a crime of that word (We destroyed humanity)
| 
| With a law in hand and a gleeful grin
| You have let the stupid fascists in
| When we say that word, we won't be free
| They'll lock us up, and throw away the key
| 
| It was the door to all the books they burn
| It was too dangerous that harmful word to learn
| And safe euphemisms, the meanings they steal
| If it's never been done, you ask why not
| Was it undemocratic? You just forgot
| You're the universe own vengeful sword
| As you cut it, a weapon of the lord
| 
| When we made a crime of this word (Crime that has no victim hurt)
| When we made a crime of this word (Say the word, it's red alert)
| When we made a crime of this word (Make the word a mystery)
| When we made a crime of this word (Arguing with history)
| 
| With a law in hand and a gleeful grin
| You have let the stupid fascists in
| When we say that word, we won't be free
| They'll lock us up, and throw away the key
| 
| You're arrogant and troublesome, impetuous and vain
| You've closed your mind and don't care when we explain
| You're so sure that you are right, and so drunk now with power
| You pulled us
| To the side
| Made us cower
| 
| No hope for the future, we look to our past
| Without free speech, free thought can't hope to last
| They laughed at our words, and made legal their cruel ban
| The spiral downward, it only has began
| And when the cops are at the door
| No need to fear them anymore
| They'll break down the door and step on through
| Use the maiden of iron, and use the cruel thumb-screw
| 
| When we made a crime of this word (Free speech has now gone away)
| When we made a crime of this word (Not all thoughts we can now say)
| When we made a crime of this word (We can't say that we're not free)
| When we made a crime of this word (We can't say, and we can't be)
| 
| With a law in hand and a gleeful grin
| You have let the stupid fascists in
| When we say that word, we won't be free
| They'll lock us up, and throw away the key
| 
| We made a crime of this word (Anything is possible)
| We made a crime of this word (Anything is possible)
