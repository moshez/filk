Scud, the short-term ballistic missile
--------------------------------------

| TTTO "Scud, the disposable assassin" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| The Iraqi regime's in a deep situation
| The US has decided now to rescue Kuwait
| Nobody seems to be into the reconcilation
| So Saddam has decided the Jews now to bait
| 
| It's Scud, Scud, the short-range ballistic missile
| Available from Russia for what dollars you got
| Point 'em at your enemy and near him they  will whistle
| But you'll find it will miss much more often than not
| ...piece of crap
| 
| The missiles they fly nightly from the deep Iraqi desert
| The batteries, they launch and than they go back and hide
| The fly across the distance, the alarms wake all the people
| Who will wait, in their rooms, 'till it finally lands
| 
| What's it got, it got, it got...
| 
| It doesn't carry mustard, it's a little less severe
| It was just some explosives, there was no gas in store 
| And the gas masks were for nothing, and we think it is now clear
| That's it launched to make us, stop avoiding the war
| 
| It's Scud, Scud...
| 
| But if we don't launch the airplanes then we don't fall for his plot
| But a psychopathic dictator's not a good think to keep
| So the patriots are launched every time a Scud is shot
| And we learn to keep our gas masks on and still to get sleep
| 
| Now this war won't be much longer but it's taken its toll
| And though we are not fighting this, we still play our own role
| So we wait patiently for peace now 'cause we're sick of this
| If you want violent retribution, give it up, our ass kiss
| 
| So we won the six-day war with ease
| We know when to fight and when to freeze
| We will this one war out
| No matter how hard you shout
| 
| It's Scud, Scud...
