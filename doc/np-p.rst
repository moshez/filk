NP != P

| TTTO "אני רואה אותה בדרך לגימנסייה" by Arik Einstein
| 
| I have a problem here, solutions take forever
| Some cities need me to be there, ASAP
| And since I have no time and flying is not free
| I wish to minimize the path on which I'll be
| 
| I cannot contemplate quite how to solve this problem
| But there's another, and I think you will agree
| That if I solve it polynomially -- in time P
| Then the last one will a problem cease to be
| 
| Can anyone here help me solve
| I knew you'd hate to be involved
| 
| For there's a formula, of true and false -- that's logic
| And it's an and of ors and each or is of three
| I need to know whether I can it satisfy, see
| I need to know if a solution is it be
| 
| Can anyone here please help me
| How come when I ask, people flee
| 
| I have a problem here, solutions take forever
| And now I fear that a solution there won't be
