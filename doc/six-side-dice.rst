Six Side Dice
-------------

| TTTO "Six String Love" by Vixy&amp;Tony
| 
| Some folks like the D&amp;D game, they play fighters, thieves and elves
| Some prefer to run the games with the rules that they made themselves
| Some folks love a game with runs through shadows and some magic
| But I need to say, that there's a better way
| If you're not afraid of some math, and you don't think it's tragic
| 
| [Chorus]
| You can write the plots I like, the encounter that lingers
| But the way to strike true is through nimble fingers
| Yeah, I don't need that whole damn batch
| Just some dice with
| Six sides that match
| 
| Take me to all the game cons, baby, take me to the open room
| Run some games there just for fun, some games with coming doom
| You can play the game like Gary, you can make a world enchanted
| Where single strike can just end the hike
| But there's no game like Champions and it's what I wanted
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| [Bridge]
| I don't have time for games that suck
| And for games that are no fun when playing
| So if you want to improve, then just thank your luck
| And listen to the words that I am saying
| Let me tell you about my Champions game
| Ooooh, what can I say
| Guys with customs on every side
| (spoken) I don't remember anything else that happened that day...
| 
| Let me choose my powers here, let me choose my talents too
| Let me read them rules, gimme power pools
| So I'll change the things I'm able to do
| Give me a villain, with a pun, gimme a world to save
| I'm a hero now, and I'll win somehow
| 'Scuse me when I blast this cave
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Yeah, I don't need that whole damn batch
| Just some dice with
| Six sides that match
| 
| Yeah, I don't need that whole damn batch
| Just some dice with
| Six sides that match
