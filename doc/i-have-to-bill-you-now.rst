I Have to Bill You Now
----------------------

| TTTO "I Have to Kill You Now" by Carla Ulbrich
| 
| It was late in the evening,
| I was tired, I was ill
| I was feeling really groggy,
| You took advantage of good will
| So you called and we talked for 5 hours
| I still remember everything
| And before I hung up the phone
| I do remember saying
| 
| [Chorus]
| I have to bill you now
| Free advice I can't allow
| You'll have to pay somehow
| I have to bill you now
| 
| I could speculate
| That this bill will not be paid
| If that's the case, expect a raid
| For every hour, that's my rate
| And this is, I think, is where we're at
| Though you're shocked, I am at ease
| If you come into my lab
| I will put you on the slab
| 
| [Chorus]
| I have to bill you now
| Free advice I can't allow
| I ain't a communist, this ain't Moscow
| I have to bill you now
| 
| It's a way some people see me,
| This is really serious,
| All nice and easy going
| Not at all imperious,
| What you do is past the border
| Of abusing my phone number
| So I'm doing this in order
| That I will be left to slumber
| 
| [Chorus]
| I have to bill you now
| Free advice I can't allow
| When you get it, you'll say "ow"
| I have to bill you now
| 
| So you wonder, did I bill him?
| Could this trick be used by you?
| I can talk more of these things
| But then I'd have to bill you too
| 
| [Chorus]
| I have to bill you now
| Free advice I can't allow
| It's good advice, so anyhow
| I have to bill you now
