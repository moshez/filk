| As I went out on the street
| And my lunch I tried to eat
| The toilet came from outer space
| Hit me right across the face
| 
| CHORUS:
| Graveling, don't kill me
| It's not my time, can't you see
| Graveling, hope and pray
| It's not me who'll go away
| 
| Pianos, banana peels
| Net the gravelings some more kills
| It's not funny, it's just is
| These deaths do the gravelings please
| 
| [CHORUS]
| 
| Let the reaping now begin
| Those the gravelings will do in
| Try and guess the victim's name
| We always play this gruesome game
| 
| [CHORUS]
| 
| I try so hard not to care
| Death to question -- who would dare?
| Every man here has a fate
| To his death he'll not be late
| [REPEAT CHORUS TWICE]
