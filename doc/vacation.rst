Vacation
--------

| TTTO "Beaded Bag" by Peter Alway (originally an instrumental)
| 
| Take your pack, coloured stones fill it with
| Go to where we are just a myth
| Pack all things you cannot do without
| Clear your mind of fear and of doubt 
| 
| [Chorus]
| Near the coast is a place
| Where we'll be free again
| Away from the rat race
| And far from the pain
| 
| Leave behind your worries and come to play
| We will learn to live for today
| Roam the coast, laughing with childish joy
| For this day the world is our toy
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| We'll be back -- there will be time for work
| But our time in here is a perk
| Let's enjoy, the future is yet not near
| Live for what we have now and here 
| 
| [Chorus]
