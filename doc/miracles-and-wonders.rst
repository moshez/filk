Miracles and Wonders
--------------------

| TTTO "Boy in the Bubble" by Paul Simon
| 
| There is a shutter-click
| And the app is beeping
| As it notices the QR codes
| There is a LED light
| When our phones connect to facebook
| So every couple's marriage
| Is sent to us by radio
| 
| [Chorus]
| There are the days of miracle and wonder,
| Like cellphones making a call
| When kids can play with better things than LOGO
| As chips can keep getting small
| The way we notice a distant exo-planet
| By seeing just a wobble in a star
| These are the days of miracle and wonder,
| We'll go far, baby, go far, go far
| 
| It's a new land
| When the thinking hits the pay-dirt
| Another idea is given birth
| And inert sand,
| Turning into silicon
| Making the transistors
| As we automate the earth
| 
| [Bridge]
| It's an automatic chat-bot
| It's making pretty pie-charts
| From shoulders of great giants, we launch into a running start
| Medicine is glorious, a life-preserving art
| Think of the boy in the bubble
| And the baby with the babboon heart
| 
| These are the days of lasers playing music
| Lasers playing music, somewhere
| Staccatto signals of bit-wise information
| No longer just for the millionaires
| Or billionairs, and baby...
| 
| [Chorus]
