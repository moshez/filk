| Little sprites of the ancient wood, got into whirling gears
| Ever since the steam engine, they've been there for years
| Now we've progressed on and on with solid-state machines
| There are no more those moving parts, no clicky whirling tins
| 
| HUMANS! HUMANS!
| Pay your dues
| Just two paths but you get to choose
| Feed us now, or data lose
| Gremlins everywhere
| 
| Machines are few, and far between, what should gremlins do?
| They all turned to digital, seaking pastures new
| They found a home in RAM and disk, sometimes a bit they flip
| And they can cause your data gone if you just give them lip
| 
| Gremlins like the bits and bytes, the zeroes and the ones
| Dumb machines are literal, they don't get gremlin puns
| Gremlins feast on code and docs, comments make their lunch
| And files with no correct backup is what they like to crunch
| 
| So if those bugs are cropping up, best thing you can do
| Is make peace with the gremlin horde, and make them work for you
| Test and document your code, the formatting keep clean
| And then they will do what you say -- but still not what you mean
