The CPU Shanty

| Now, in the old days, shanties were used to synchronize sailors on various areas of the boat doing the heavy hauling. Nowadays, the CPU sends ticks to synch up the various parts in the computer. Here's how I imagine lyrics to those ticks would go.
| 
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one, oh
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one, oh
| 
| The program it is loaded now
| And now I start to run it
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one, oh
| It is so long, I go to work
| I read it to the last bit
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one, oh
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one
| Word, get the word, add it to the last one, oh
| 
| So many bytes, so many words
| All needing execution
| Word...
| And I will get to rest in peace
| When I have the solution
| Word...
| 
| From CPU to APU
| The bits and bytes are rolling
| Word...
| The clock now must be accurate
| The ticks it be controlling
| Word...
| 
| To add, divide and multiply
| Transistors running current
| Word...
| With pipeline to speed up the bus
| Instructions are concurrent
| Word...
| 
| Word...
