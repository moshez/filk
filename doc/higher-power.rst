Higher Power
------------

| No tune yet.
| 
| For each set of some elements, there is the power set
| If you take all its subsets, than this will be what you get
| The function that for each x gives the set of order one
| Containing it is will prove that it's not smaller, this side's done
| 
| [Chorus]
| A higher power always exists
| There's always something more
| No matter just how you persist
| A larger set will always soar
| 
| A set to all its subsets, for each function, let us take
| The elements that are not in their image, a set make
| Now, for each member of the set, its image cannot be
| This set of curious elements, I hope you will agree
| 
| For if it is the image of some member, call it k
| It is contained in this set, or it isn't, either way
| If it's contained than it is not, if not than it's contained
| This paradox now shows us that a valid proof we gained
| 
| So now we know the power set cannot be equal to
| The set that it is made of, and so now we see it's true
| It is the higher power, and this set is larger still
| And so the powers of the sets, they always go uphill
