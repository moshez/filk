What If I Were Kathleen Sloan
-----------------------------

| TTTO "What If Your Girlfriend Was Gone" by Carla Ulbrich
| With special apologies to Kathleen Sloan...
| 
| Based on "Kathleen, Catalogue Queen" and "Kathleen, Discipline Queen"
| 
| I was just wondering, hypothetically
| What would I do, theoretically
| If something would happen accidentally or medically
| What if I were Kathleen Sloan?
| 
| If I ordered from catalogues a new light fixture
| Or happened to get some new beads in a mixture
| Would the cataologues find their way into the picture
| If I could just get on the phone?
| 
| [Chorus]
| Would I call them up
| When they send me a letter?
| Would they try to upsell me to something better?
| Would they send me five more catalogues all bound up in leather?
| What if I were Kathleen Sloan?
| 
| If I disappeared without a trace
| Instead of me, t'would be Kathleen in my place
| And I happened to be just wearing her face?
| Not that I have any plans!
| 
| I'm not suggesting that just to tease ya
| But what if I was suddenly struck with amnesia
| And imagined myself to be Kathleen, would it please ya?
| Do you really think I honestly can?
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Of course, as you know, I'd not give it a whirl
| For I have to insist, it is out of this world
| But I cannot help but wondering about
| Her other side, when she'll order and shout
| 
| If something should happen, hypothetically
| What would I do, theoretically?
| If should something should happen, accidentally or medically?
| What if I were Kathleen Sloan?
| 
| [Chorus]
| What I tie you up
| Just to make me feel better
| Would I make you think "I'd better not upset her"?
| Would I make sure you were punished, if we would be together?
| What if I were Kathleen Sloan?
