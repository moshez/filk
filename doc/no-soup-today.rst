No Soup Today
-------------

| TTTO "Nothing to Say" by Carla Ulbrich
| 
| I stood and listened to your story
| You thought "it's deep, evocatory"
| But you pushed before your turn
| For all I care, you can go burn
| 'Cause you'll have no soup today
| 
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| At home I was a simple cook, I treasured every spice
| Now that I am in New York, with speed I chop and dice
| And you'll get no soup today
| 
| I consulted all the cook books, my soups have not been hacked
| I used my expertise, my soups were all exact
| What you did was kind of hasty, it was surely not that smart
| Now I really do not care if I've broken your poor heart
| You'll get no soup today
| 
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| My recipes are secret, I'm guarding every page
| And if you try to steal them, expect to meet my rage
| And to get no soup today
| 
| So try to be more serious, and get outside your head
| I cannot say to you any more than I have already said
| My soup, you know is awesome, full of originality
| Now I must ask you all to give up and yield to me
| You can have no soup today
| 
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| At home I practiced hours, mastering arcane techniques
| So now I'm barring you -- for at least two dozen weeks
| And to get no soup today
| 
| I care not about the planet, not even just one tree
| And I stop abuse by those who try their hand abusing me
| My soups won't sell in churches, not even at peace rally
| You can have no soup today
| 
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| At home I was a genius, no two soups were the same
| So now I dictate the rules of this convoluted day
| So you get no soup today
| 
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| No soup no soup no soup no soup no soup today
| I have a special soup, using my own style and wit
| I moved to New York with hopes up -- I think I finally have a hit
| So you get no soup today
