| When the pages fly down the internet tubes
| And the HTML is rendered to screen
| Sometimes it works, if the standard is kept
| And the code and the graphics try to be clean
| There's a simple standard, they embrace and extend
| If there's two ways about it, then they choose a third
| There were wars we won, and then a war that we lost
| Then we freed the code, made a splash that was heard!
| 
| It's called firefox, but it was firebird
| Don't you tell me that I'm just a nerd
| 
| [Chorus]
| Take my SYN, take my ACK
| Drop 'em and don't give 'em back
| I don't care, it's still free
| You can't take the code from me
| Take me to the internet
| Just let me perform a GET
| From the standards make debris
| You can't take the code from me
| 
| When you see a man, and he's surfing alone
| Well you can assume that he's searching for porn
| The righteous forbid it, and sniff to make sure
| But men will be men, from the time that they're born
| Religious fanatics and the government hounds
| Protecting virtue and censoring you
| But my browser's got 128 bits
| Hard core encryption, they can't break through
| 
| Don't you think I care 'bout you and your crew
| There's nothing that my browser can't do
| 
| 
| When you've read the code, and you've seen what I've seen
| Well you won't go talkin' 'bout leak free code
| You'll see the memory usage go through the roof
| Yes running that program is quite a load
| I've seen browsers crash from Javascript bugs
| Seen HTML which good design mocks
| With FONT and CENTER, WIRED and BLINK
| Non-standard elements by droves and flocks
| 
| My God, got to get out of this box
| Still I got my browser -- that's Firefox
