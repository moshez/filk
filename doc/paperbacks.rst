Paperbacks
----------

| TTTO "Paper Moon" from Seanan McGuire's "Stars Fall Home"
| 
| I think that I read too much sci-fi
| I'm gonna switch to books that make me cry
| I wanna go to a con about romance
| But I don't think I'm gonna get my chance
| Though that doesn't mean I've stopped for good
| I'll still read what junk sci-fi I could
| So tell my friends that I'm jumping ship
| And I'll just ignore them if they're giving lip
| 
| I don't want to have to think of rules,
| This science stuff for me is much too hard
| For robots and these other tools --
| I think my mind's by now already scarred
| But just because I wanna turn brain off
| I want a veg out read, I want to rest my mind
| I don't think that you should at me so scoff
| Don't think that I am m not as refined
| 
| [Chorus]
| Paperbacks and romance stuff
| Lots and lots and lots of fluff
| I can read forever never think too much
| And the heroes don't do more than touch
| 
| I don't want to live so afraid to read
| And this sci-fi stuff makes my mind leak out
| I think that what I now so need
| Is a story that is of love about
| I'll get these books now, ten for five
| They're all the same, on this I thrive
| So tell my friends that I'm jumping ship
| And I'll just ignore them if they're giving lip
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I think that I read too much sci-fi
| I'm gonna switch to books that make me cry
| I wanna go to a con about romance
| But I don't think I'm gonna get my chance
| Though that doesn't mean I've stopped for good
| I'll still read what junk sci-fi I could
| So tell my friends that I'm jumping ship
| And I'll just ignore them if they're giving lip
| 
| [Chorus]
