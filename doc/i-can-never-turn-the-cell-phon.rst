I Can Never Turn the Cell Phone Off
-----------------------------------

| TTTO "Tequila Makes Her Clothes Come Off" by John Nichols
| 
| When I'm going out with good friends,
| I grab my cellphone much to their chagrin
| Lord have mercy for my only thought's
| I can never turn the cell phone off
| 
| Not an extra, it's not just a phone
| It's not a sin for which I must atone
| It's my salvation, what I always sought
| I can never turn the cell phone off
| 
| [Chorus]
| It isn't about how much it's used
| No matter what you think
| When I'm outside, when I'm far from home
| I will always have my link
| 
| I turn my music player off and on
| And mostly use it when I'm all alone
| But it won't help you if you spit and froth
| I can never turn the cell phone off
| 
| My laptop's always turned off during lunch
| I like to concentrate on food I munch
| But no matter how much people scoff
| I can never turn the cell phone off
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I used to say that it was just for fun
| But I guess when all is said and done
| You can joke about the friends I've lost
| I can never turn the cell phone off
| No, I never turn the cell phone off,
| Oh, I'll never turn the cell phone off!
