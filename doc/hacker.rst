| When I was younger, just a bad little kid,
| My parents noticed funny things I did,
| Like loading Linux up in GDB
| Just to find kalloc that had no free
| I'd write a patch when I found the leak
| I really was a geek
| 
| [Users]
| He's such a geek
| 
| [Coder]
| But I hoped and prayed someday
| I'll find a way
| To make my natural tendencies pay
| I'll be a hacker
| I have a talent for fixing stuff
| I'll be a hacker
| And to be payed for my play is enough
| My temprament's bad for the sales force
| And marketing would suit me less
| I'll be a hacker,
| I'll be a success
| 
| [Users]
| Here he is, folks the fixer of the bugs!
| Watch him patch up that code
| Oh, my god!
| He's a hacker and he'll never ever be social
| Who wants their source done by a hippie with hair
| 
| [Manager]
| How long now! It's not done
| 
| [ORIN]
| Oh, shut up. Wait a sec, it's so faun
| I am your hacker
| 
| [Manager]
| Goodness gracious!
| 
| [Coder]
| And I enjoy the career that I picked
| 
| [Users]
| Really love it
| 
| [Coder]
| I am your hacker
| 
| [Manager]
| Making kludges
| 
| [Coder]
| And I get off on the code that I fix
| 
| [Users]
| Really love it
| 
| [Coder]
| I thrill when I write algoithms
|

| [Coder]
| It's swell though they tell me I'm maladjusted
| And though it may cause my bosses distress,
| Somewhere, somewhere in the world around me
| I know, I know, that the users are running this
| Oh, users
| 'Cause I'm a hacker and a success
| Say bash!
| 
| [Manager]
| Bash!
| 
| [Coder]
| Say bash!
| 
| [Manager]
| Bash!
| 
| [Coder]
| Say bash!
| 
| [Manager]
| Bash!
| 
| [Coder]
| Now !
