| There's a school, on the mouth of hell
| And quite near it, many vampires dwell
| But it looks normal, you couldn't tell
| The vampires roam at night
| 
| And there's a girl, in this hellish school
| And in LA, she was pretty cool
| Yet here, she fights the vampires' rule
| She slays them left and right
| 
| The vampires say, "Buffy, you're a fine girl
| What a good meal you would be
| Yeah your blood is all I require
| To nourish me."
| 
| Buffy, wears a braided chain
| With a cross, to ward away the pain
| Of the fangs: it was a gift
| From the vampire that she loved
| 
| He came, on a summer's day
| Being mysterious, she couldn't slay
| But they realized, he couldn't stay
| For too much was at stake
| 
| The vampire said, "Buffy, you're a fine girl
| What a good lay you would be
| But my soul, it will go forever
| The gypsies cursed me
| 
| Yeah Buffy used to watch his abs when he told his sad sob story
| And the tale of how he got his soul really made her feel sorry
| But he could not feel happiness, Lord that made him quite a pain
| And Buffy does her best to understand
| 
| At night, when the Bronze closed down
| Buffy walked through a silent town
| Killed vampires without a frown,
| She remembered what Angel said, yes angel said
| 
| "Buffy, you're a fine girl
| What a good lay you would be
| But my soul, it will go forever
| The gypsies cursed me
| 
| "Buffy, you're a fine girl
| What a good lay you would be
| But my soul, it will go forever
| The gypsies cursed me
