One Small Moat
--------------

| TTTO "One Small Boat" by Marilisa Valtazanou
| 
| The people next village are surrounded by villains
| They ran from the guns and they ran from the whips
| To build all their castles they went through all hells -- and
| They built strongholds, castles like they've seen on their trips
| 
| You turn and you ask me "Don't you want such castles?
| With guards in the towers all ready and tough?"
| I say "Not for me -- such big things are mere hassles,
| And for me one small moat is enough."
| 
| They came and attacked us, they tried and take over
| They've threatened and yelled and they puffed and they huffed
| They'll always be out there, we run and take cover
| For me, one small moat is enough.
| 
| The people in town are all conquered by villains
| They search for their freedom, in vain is their quest
| They each hope to find some release from the killin'
| They struggle and struggle, but our way is best
| 
| I turn and I ask you, "Oh, look how they wallow
| Their yells reach the sky when the lord comes via boat."
| You say, "My beloved, those people are hollow,
| We'll stay, here us two, with the moat."
| 
| They came and attacked us, they tried and take over
| They've threatened and yelled and they puffed and they huffed
| They'll always be out there, we run and take cover
| For me, one small moat is enough.
| 
| Freedom's forgotten, their life is so shallow
| They're all disenchanted with what they have seen
| The villagers live knowing their lives are hollow
| All the folk suffer, no matter who's queen
| 
| A tower is fickle -- the guard must be faithful
| And all of those troubles now seem quite remote
| We sit in our house, each day we are grateful
| For the wisdom we share and our one tiny moat
| 
| They came and attacked us, they tried and take over
| They've threatened and yelled and they puffed and they huffed
| They'll always be out there, we run and take cover
| For me, one small moat is enough.
| 
| We've lived here, it's good life we both cherish, no wonder 
| Each day, we live in safety and we make love
| They'll always be out there, we run and take cover
| For me, one small moat is enough.
