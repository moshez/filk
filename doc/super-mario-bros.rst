Super Mario Bros.

| TTTO "Re: Your Brains", Jonathan Coulton
| 
| Hi Mario, it's me, Luigi, don't you know
| Good to see you brother, in this place
| Things don't look ok for us, for, see we're in a new universe
| I really wish we'd have a mace
| I think that I can safely say that we don't understand
| What is just the meaning of this deadly little land
| But here's just what I think: we're both gonna be jumping
| 
| [Chorus]
| All we want to do is clear your drains
| We're not invincible, if you kill us we will die
| All we want to do is clear your drains
| We're at this strange strange world, but no matter what we'll try
| Open up the floors, we will fall inside
| And clear your drains
| 
| I don't want to nitpick, Mar, but it seems we have no plan
| Will we free the princess from the fort?
| Maybe that's OK for us, but someday we'll be just plain out of luck
| And our jumps will fall too short
| I'm not surprised to see that we are winning, after all
| We are quite used to having the floor beneath us fall
| But bro, I think I'm scared: and I think that we will fail shortly
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I'd like to help Princess, in any way I can
| I sure appreciate the way you're working with me
| I'm just a plumber, bro, well technically I am
| You know I am
| 
| I think we should head back now, maybe we could wrap it up
| I know that we will both get home somehow
| Meanwhile we'll keep jumping to the place where we both want to be in
| I guess we have survived -- for now
| I'm sad to see that we have fallen down this deep well
| For the way it looks to me, I believe it's worth than hell
| And we'll try to forget, when we reach our home safely
| 
| [Chorus]
