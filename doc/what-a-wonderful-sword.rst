What a Wonderful Sword
----------------------

| TTTO "What a Wonderful World" by George Douglas and George David Weiss
| 
| I see people bleed, the color's blood red
| I see 'em cut, and I see them dead
| And I think to myself what a wonderful sword.
| 
| The colors of when a man dies, so pretty in my eyes
| He now is much more truthful, I'm sure he'll tell no lies
| I see foes run away, saying, "he is insane"
| What they're really fearing is some pain
| 
| I hear babies cry, when their parents die
| So many I kill don't say goodbye
| And I think to myself what a wonderful sword.

| I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow
| *spoken*(you know their gonna learn
| A whole lot more than Ill never know)
