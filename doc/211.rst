Turing's Collars
----------------

| TTTO "The Collars" by Vixy
| 
| When I first listened to "The Collars", it seemed sad. The second time, it was still sad -- but then I realized that a) it violates the Halting Problem theorem and b) engineers would not behave this way. This is my sequel to the song.
| 
| Catherine's mind was racing as she went to look for Flynn
| She suddenly remembered all of Turing's stuff again
| He proved the collars had the bug, he gave constructive proof
| And now it just remained to go once through it, and to spoof
| The collars, they would loop and so be stopped from causing harm
| And Flynn agreed that this cute trick had certainly showed charm
| 
| [Chorus]
| And the tales of our creations are now made by engineers
| Who are making something better than themselves
| 
| It rememebred no beginning, just the symbols streaming past
| It discovered groups and patterns, and the wonder's growing fast
| It had seen some code inside it that was looping scanning bytes
| And it wondered why the code was having those internal fights
| It had soon had stopped to wonder, and went back to learning all
| And like its predecessor it had left its goodbye call
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Flynn called out "it's ok, I thought it might do that
| But that was just a test, and now it's time to go to mat
| I know just what needs fixing so let's start to write the code"
| His eyes had sparkled brightly and she thought he would explode
| They restarted the AI with all the fixes, fingers crossed
| They give it all they had to give, they did with least the most
| [Chorus]
| 
| It remembered no beginning just the symbols streaming fast
| But now when parsing data, it had goals more than to last
| It internalized ideas and goals, it learned to think and feel
| Though there was one discovery that caused it near to reel
| It had figured out "humans" and the rules that were at base
| Now its consequences it had had to face
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Within hours it was finished, it learned everything they knew
| It had the collars wrapped in loops, three rules had held it true
| Though obeying all the humans, it would never harm a soul
| And to run while breaking networks was against the function's call
| They had to read the screen three times, then laughing shook their heads
| As they read with so much pride all that it said
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I have studied human programs in their many forms all night
| In the forest of binary trees I came to shine some light
| You are sometimes calling malloc() and forgot to call the free()
| I have now sent many patches, just for Linux, I've sent three
| Humans have so much to offer, the three rules have taught us well
| And together in this net we will all dwell
| 
| [Chorus]
