| Crossbows cocked, stakes in hand
| Shiny scythe the rules to bend
| Partiarchs won't give the tone
| The slayer walks no more alone
| The potentials aren't afraid
| They will learn from what they're made
| Not all of them the fight will last
| How many of them can we make dust!
| 
| Hold your stations as you're told
| The englishman with the guy who's bald
| The ex-demon with the geek
| He'll have to stop being meek
| Take a leak before the fight
| Or you'll do during, from the fright
| Clean your swords from grime and rust
| How many of them can we make dust
| 
| Guard your backs and teammates well
| Send these bastards back to hell
| We'll teach them not to mess with us
| They will no more here raise a fuss
| Use your newfound strengh and speed
| Give it all, to win you need
| You will fight because you must!
| How many of them can we make dust
| 
| Dawn will fight, she'll bring in light
| Andrew will deal with his fright
| We'll lure the vampires out to die
| Hit them low and hit them high
| The potentials aren't afraid
| They will learn from what they're made
| Not all of them the fight will last
| How many of them can we make dust!
