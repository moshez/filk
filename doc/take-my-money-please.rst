Take My Money Please
--------------------

| No tune yet.
| 
| It is a well known policy, that you should follow friend
| If money you would ask of me, make it an easy spend
| Pile not the rules and hoops and proofs, please make sure I'm at ease
| I am the one who's buying, see, try harder me to pleasse
| 
| [Chorus]
| If you want my money, open your hand
| Don't try to make me force it through
| I will not do as you command
| You'll lose the deal, and that you'll rue
| 
| I will not give my mail to you, nor personal details
| For all I know, your dinky store, in privacy it fails
| Don't ask me to try hard to choose a password for your site
| Just take my money, smile and thank, and try to be polite
| 
| So I will bid goodbye to you, if money you won't take
| In private I will think, it's true, that you made a mistake
| And now I go to places where they want my business more
| Now read this song I wrote to you, and bye bye, dear senore
