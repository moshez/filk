The Alpha-Beta Song
-------------------

| Another one without a TTTO. They multiply. This one was because the Israeli filk community has decided to protest the lack of songs of Beta Centauri, a star not less worthy of attention than Alpha.
| 
| We came to the earth from afar
| Frozen for most of the distance
| And though earthmen can see our home star
| Their mistakes they still make with persistence!
| 
| Chorus:
| We hail from the star Beta
| Our pride do not insult
| You do not have the data
| These alphans are a cult!
| 
| Alpha Centauri's a place
| Where all of the natives are crazy
| They're dirty with mud on their face
| And frankly, we think that they're lazy
| 
| But still all you people still think
| From Alpha, our neighbour, we landed
| Although there the natives all stink
| And they're still, on their planet, stranded
| 
| So tell me how can you mistake
| Us for the look of our cousins?
| We all hope, sometime soon, you will wake
| The distinctions are there by the dozens
| 
| The alphans all wear garb of green
| Our green is a tad different shaded
| And they had a king and a queen
| 'Till their planet, well, we had invaded
