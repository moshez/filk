| In this song, I quest for lyrics
| But they come not to me
| "Writing words is the point of filk"
| But alas it will not be
| It is hard to write the lyrics
| When the words don't come to mind
| Perhaps I can beg for lyrics,
| If people will be kind
| 
| For lyrics can move minds and hearts
| And hold allure for fen
| But the lyrics don't flow easily
| To the paper from my pen
| 
| In my life, I've written lyrics
| Perhaps I'm tapped out now
| I know I can come up with lyrics
| But I have forgotten how
| If I try to surf to rhymezone
| At least it will suck less
| My friends, for this I'm sorry
| But this song turns out a mess
| 
| For lyrics of a fairy tale
| That everybody knows
| For ideas to write my lyrics
| I intend to turn to prose
| 
| Still I try to quest for lyrics
| With my laptop on my knees
| I still yearn to find my muse, for
| My quest perhaps she'll ease
| With my hands upon the keyboard
| And vi in insert mode
| I try to write out song words
| But I'm too used to writing code
| 
| For lyrics are within my grasp
| If I just try hard enough
| I just hope the lyrics will come soon
| Why should it be so tough?
| 
| Shall I despair of finding lyrics
| Or shall be brave and strong?
| Could it be that sometime soon
| The ideas would come along
| This song is almost over
| And the words are almost done
| And before this song is finished
| I will come up with a pun
| 
| For lyrics are so hard to find
| This close to the end
| But I know where to find lyrics
| If I put them on my stand
