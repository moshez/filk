One, Threes, and a Seven
------------------------

| TTTO "Threes" by Mercedes Lackey and Leslie Fish
| 
| Loosely based on the "1337" 5-part XKCD series.
| 
| Somewhere in suburbia
| Where parents go relax
| A mother is now baking
| And with just one hand she hacks
| She's playing with the wifi
| And she rewrites TCP
| And all the hackers, everywhere
| Want just like her to be
| 
| Three things see no end,
| A loop that has no exit code
| The number of transistors
| And the circle in a road
| 
| She won't allow you to encrypt
| 'Cause mother always knows
| So VPNs and SSH
| Those sockets she will close
| She may not look and dress and part
| But trust me when I say
| That in the game for who has skills
| One other'll only play
| 
| Three things are most perilous
| Technician with patch
| That mother's youngest daughter
| And the man who's met his match
| 
| Little did that lady care
| Her son's name burned the school
| For little bobby tables knows
| His real name's just so cool
| For she likes puns and funny jokes
| And names with meta tricks
| Her daughter, she is named Elaine,
| With first name just for kicks
| 
| Of three things be wary of,
| The user's input strings
| The overflowing buffers
| And the source IP of pings
| 
| When eleven this kid turned,
| The master she had met
| Had taught her all that he had known
| And that she'd not forget
| She could not leave the mountain home
| Before she had him beat
| But he just had to let her go
| Her code was just too l33t
| 
| Three things are impossible,
| To know when programs halt
| To solve those NP problems
| And to fix a mem'ry fault
| 
| She'd break into the NSA
| For giggles and for fun
| And also to make just quite sure
| That RSA's not done
| She learned of copyright abuse
| Of Disney's bribes and crimes
| The iPod -- that was her idea
| Somewhere to put our rhymes
| 
| Three things are incredible,
| Technology that's new
| The internet and a release
| That's done by deadline's due
| 
| She cracked up all the DRM
| The bad guys took up arms
| The new laws they had bought for that
| To fight some made up "harms"
| She'd come to realize that it was legal
| What they do
| For when the people are asleep
| The law that's passed they'll rue
| 
| Three things never trust in,
| A law to save the kids
| A law to fight technology
| And one that speech forbids
| 
| She was not left to her demise
| For hackers know their own
| And so a guy named R M S
| Said, "you'd not fight alone"
| He brandished his Katana sword
| The lawyers, they felt fear
| They had no plan and no recourse
| To fight, they'd need -- this year
| 
| Three things can still save our ass
| The freedoms that remain
| When we help fight each other's fights
| And don't forgot our brain
| 
| The blogosphere can get the drop
| On those that creep by night
| And Cory D and R M S
| Will help us in the fight
| And those who are called pirates
| Are our friends, because you see
| The global warming they help stop
| When they sail on the sea
| 
| Three things please remember --
| We must win in the end,
| Our rights -- we must protect them still,
| The internet's your friend
