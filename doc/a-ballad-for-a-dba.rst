A Ballad For a DBA

| 
| It's a tale of woe and malice, a tale of a DBA
| That the users learned to fear and to get out of his way
| He would drop production tables when complaints had grown to loud
| He would smile and feign surprise and then suggested "use the cloud"
| 
| He would backup every hour but would not deign to restore
| "If it's gone, just be more careful, it's just me the backup's for"
| He would kill off all the queries that had gone on way too long
| When the users would complain he would just say that they are wrong
| 
| When the database expanded
| And the system was too slow
| He just shrugged, "go talk to network --
| Go tell them your tales of woe"
| 
| When the backups all are running and the database is gone
| He won't care about the users, just let an evil yawn
| When the disks will come down crashing, if it's way too late at night
| He'll just sets his cell to "silent", waits until the morning light
| 
| When the database expanded
| And the network was too slow
| He just shrugged, "go talk to network --
| Go tell them your tales of woe"
| 
| When the database expanded
| I/O rates became too high
| He just shrugged, "go talk to storage --
| Or just go crawl off and die"
| 
| And the coders told him - "Buddy,
| All your indices are wrong"
| So he told them, "It's your queries,
| and your fault they take too long"
