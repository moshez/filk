Stolen Pleasures
----------------

| TTTO "Guilty Pleasures" by Steve Savitzky
| 
| Now the CD player is blaring
| Music I got from a friend
| I sing, windows open, through traffic I drive
| And the lyrics I'm craving to bend
| And I know that I ought to be stronger
| And I know that it just ain't right
| But the muse is incessantly calling
| And I'm gonna be losing this fight
|  
| It is such a pleasure
| Destroying treasures
| Although I still know it is wrong
| The devil takes mimes,
| And violent crimes
| I can scare you all off with a song
| 
| Now some people think it's insulting
| Some think that the old tune is marred
| When it's bent out of shape, sings of Harry or Snape
| They would like all such things to be barred
| But just give me a tape with new folksongs
| Traffic as heavy as hell
| A red light or two, where there's nothing to do
| And to save all the lyrics, a cell 
| 
| There's a thing I can do with the rhyme here
| A twist I can give to a word
| There's a joke I can play on a story
| You'll get if you're really a nerd
| If the tune wasn't really that catchy
| I wouldn't be singing along
| So if I have come up with new lyrics
| It means I am liking this song
| 
| Well I finally got where I'm going
| The song will be up on the blog
| I might live in fear for a short time
| I might have to hide in the fog
| Now some men think it is sinning
| And others just think I waste time
| But if it makes people laugh, I am winning
| When I make up a joke and a rhyme
