You're Different Now
--------------------

| Tune: Original (recording coming soon)
| 
| I always wanted to get to space, look at my surprise
| For the accident changed my fate, now I got my prize
| Now I know that the human race isn't all alone
| Never knew that I'd like to date an alien I've known
| 
| [Chorus]
| Look at how you're different now
| It defies belief
| There's a flaw in upholding law
| When you're now a thief
| 
| I know this weird thing that we had was a real tough time
| It's been a long and rocky road, and an uphill climb
| I never thought that you'd be this mad, look at what you've done
| Are you doing this just to goad? This is not much fun
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Our time together has been increased, a few hours more
| No time to work on our feelings, tough, as we win the war
| Your time as Aeryn was all but ceased, Vala Mal Doran
| So we fixed several galaxies, what's next on the plan?
| 
| [Chorus]
