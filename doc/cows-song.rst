Cow's Song
----------

| The first three verses scan to "Purple Cow" (it's a poem, not a song), and the rest are TTTO "Mal's Song".
| 
| It's kind of a weird cross-over between firefly and the purple cow. And the plot of "Cows with guns"
| 
| Yeah, insanity rules here.
| 
| I've never met a purple cow
| I wouldn't want to milk it
| But I can tell you here and now
| Its humour, I can bilk it
| 
| A purple cow is a beast
| Which sane minds cannot deal with
| But, you see, to say the least
| They are quite the ideal myth
| 
| For purple cows are quite rare
| Their skin as smooth as silk is
| And when to parody we dare
| Well, you will know what filk is
| 
| When the purple cows are featured in song
| Well, the sane men hearing flee in fear
| Well you can hope and pray that it won't be long
| Or you can dull the pain by drinking some beer
| There's a certain rhyme you'll never forget
| Though you heard it often, so it's now a bore
| There's a parody, and another one then
| As though the first one opened the door
| But I can't resist so I'll write one more
| One which is filled by blood and gore
| 
| [Chorus]
| Take the cow, take it far
| So my sight it will not mar
| But if not, then please let me
| Avoid the purple one to be
| Take the cow into the black
| And avoid to bring them back
| Make sure that I will not see
| You can't force me one to be
| You can't force me one to be
| 
| When you take a cow, and make it abort
| And the fetus put in formaldehyde
| You can me it look like an alien
| But from the doctor, you cannot hide
| I think it shows that the cows here
| Gonna take what's ours and tear us through
| So please prepare for the war ahead
| For if we fail, this day we'll rue
| Let me tell you now what we must do
| Please make the cows run from you
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| When they all got guns, we'll run for our lives
| For the fight ahead, I'll not bet on men
| You'll know damn well why I want to keep to my sky
| To keep the chickens in copters from coming again
| I've seen the cows rise and take up arms
| Seen sane men flee from the purple ones
| We're trying hard to make our stand
| But we're gonna lose to cows with guns
| 'Tis the tale we're gonna tell our suns
| The steaks are higher than our puns
| 
| [Chorus]
