Through Merging Branches
------------------------

| TTTO "Through Woven Branches" by Ben Newman
| 
| Through the life that we have spent here
| We have called this change our own
| We have fixed this, we have morphed it
| Turning each and every stone
| 
|  For we know that we are masters
|  Any changes cannot last here
|  And we know this mission now is ours
|  In our hearts we carry all the scars
| 
| All the work here, we will cherish
| We know just how hard it was
| Yet each thing might need to perish
| If we have a worthy cause
| 
|  And when fires raging, burning
|  Through the fixes we'll be churning
|  Fixing is a work that never ends
|  As we work in teams, and with our friends
| 
| Know, then, that we still remember
| How it's easy to destroy
| So we teach to all our memebers
| How to test ere they deploy
| 
|  Here, in midst of all these changes
|  Common folks will call us mages
|  But we know the language that is true
|  If you'd like it we can teach you too
