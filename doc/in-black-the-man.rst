In Black -- the Man
-------------------

| TTTO "Stray Dog Man" by Bill Sutton
| Note: Still some scansion issues I need to clean up. Singer beware!
| 
| I've long ago left home, and I drive here on the road
| The aliens who choose to stay all keep me on my toes
| But it's the humans who go too far, and I don't see why it's me
| Who have to play a meter maid in this corner of the galaxy
| 
| [Chorus]
| I'm in black -- the man, and I do what I can
| To keep you poor old humans in the dark
| But I wish the ones in space would stay there in their place
| 'Cause the aliens can't find a place to park
| 
| I was sittin' back in HQ in my jacket, having a beer
| It was a hot and muggy evenin', but the sky was not that clear
| When I heard a distant echo of a crash in 5 Space-lane
| So I run outside, and got to space, and thought "oh, no, again?"
| 
| And I could see the Mir space station had a scratch across its back
| Despite my fears and horrors it was no alien attack
| Just some Venus ship politely parking in the dark night sky
| Was crashing as the station Mir was rudely flying by
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| There were some memories to erase, and ones to plant instead
| But at least there were no casualties, got back in time for bed
| I've been going out every night alone, I don't know what to do
| As the spaceships are colliding with the vessels spaced by you
| 
| Spoken:
| It's really cute that you're going to space, though.
| I just hope you don't hit anyone from Ursa Major --
| They're a Major pain in the Urse
| 
| I finally got the NASA budget cut and I was glad to find
| That you're all getting back to earth and leaving space behind
| I'm telling you, it was a war I had no strength to fight
| So people don't go flying out into the crowded night
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I thought that was the end of it, but then a month went by
| The goddamn silly SpaceShip One is going up to fly
| I went outside to smooth the feathers, all the aliens cursed
| But as you could deduce by what it's called, it's just the first
| 
| It happens every month or so, I'm rather getting vexed
| As soon as they got one to fly, they're working on the next
| So I'm getting on a rocket, I ain't never coming back
| I won't be here when Ursa finally's going to attack
| 
| [Chorus]
