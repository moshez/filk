Pillar of Flame
---------------

| TTTO "Horse with No Name"
| 
| When I was but a baby
| In the water I started my life
| Those are the songs that they all sing
| But it doesn't mean a thing
| The first thing I knew was my life as a prince
| Escaping the crowds
| The bush was aflame and the heat was dry
| And the air was full of sound
| 
| [Chorus]
| I've walked through the desert with a pillar of flame
| As the people did naught but complain
| In the desert you can follow the flame
| It will keep on burning, 'cause there's never no rain
| Nye nye nye, nanana, ...
| 
| After running through the desert sun
| We came to the sea which is red
| It parted before us, we started to run
| Across the dry sea bed
| As the story unfolds, when it's all said and told
| I was sad that the army was dead
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now we're a new people, and we are free
| As we walk from sea to sea
| Those are the song that they all sing
| But it doesn't mean a thing
| In the desert there are hidden lakes underground
| With a rock to disguise them above
| I have led you to water and now I'll turn around
| To the homeland that I love
| 
| [Chorus]
