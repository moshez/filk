Bolt of Lightning
-----------------

| TTTO "Kung-fu Fighting" by Carl Douglas
| 
| [Chorus]
| The wizard cast bolt of lightning
| For our life we were fighting
| I can tell you, it was quite frightening
| Our party thief was climbing
| 
| We were just adventurers, in this dungeon we were stuck
| We were caught in goblins' trap, we were just plain out of luck
| We made mistakes, were not that smart, now everybody did their part
| We cannot afford a slip, or this will be our last live trip
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| We had a wizard level five, we hoped he will keep us alive
| He said "my spells are out now, I hope we'll survive"
| We hoped it not be our last stand, started fighting hand-to-hand
| Our thief took out his own whip, with the metal-studded tip
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The thief for safety climbing
| As the wizard casts bolt of lightning
