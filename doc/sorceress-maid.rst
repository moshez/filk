Sorceress Maid
--------------

| TTTO Echo's Children "Warrior Maid"
| 
| They called me hard hearted and bringer of strife
| When they saw the evil I'd done
| For my mother and father I killed with a knife
| When I needed zombies for fun
| 
| [Chorus]
| For I am a sorceress; death walks at my shoulder
| And preversion of life is my trade
| The staff is not harder, and ice is not colder
| Then the heart of a sorceress maid
| 
| He came to the battlefield to gather the slain
| His army of ghouls to increase
| The zombies to raise and to feast on a brain
| In death they would find no release
| 
| As I stood in the shadows, to hide from his sight
| He picked those most whole of the men
| And I found myself watching him, starting his rite
| Reminding myself once again
| 
| I brought from the battlefield the best of the best
| Approaching his castle with dread
| For I knew that this day, I was charged with a quest
| To enter his lab and his bed
| 
| As he taught me my skills I have flourished and grown
| I learned all he taught me and more
| And although he suspected I wanted his throne
| I learned from him all of his lore
| 
| No servent am I, but a sorceress still
| And my husband walks proud at my side
| And no wizard has harmed him and none ever will,
| For this zombie has already died
| 
| [Chorus]
| For I am a sorcereress; death keeps me in wonder
| And the ruin of life is my trade
| And my army is ready for pillage and plunder
| With the will of a sorceress maid
| And there can be nothing, above me or under
| To challenge a sorcerress maid
