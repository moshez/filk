Urban Flying
------------

| Tune: original (no notes)
| 
| I was nursing a beer, too tired to think
| The guy next to me gave me a wink
| Said I'll tell you a secret about this place
| He could see disbelief was in my face
| 
| Said, "there are two buildings, side-by-side
| The ovens downstairs are heavy and wide
| When the air gets hot, you know, it will rise"
| And I saw a twinkle shine in his eyes
| 
| [Chorus]
| Just throw your arms wide, just let yourself go
| Up the air roars, feel the wind blow
| You know, if you try it, you can get to fly
| Hang up in the air and reach for the sky
| 
| "I don't believe" I said to him
| "'Cause gravity ain't just a dream"
| If you don't believe let money talk
| I'll go, jump down, away I'll walk
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I saw him jumping, he came right back
| My eyes bulged out, my jaw went slack
| With a big ol' smile he came to the door
| Said, gimme my money, settle the score
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| "Go ahead, try it," he said to me
| I was so drunk, I did agree
| I went and jumped, and, well, went splat
| And so I died, yeah, just like that
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| 'Cause Clark's a mean drunk, I'll tell you
| Shows off things that he can do
| Lost my money and now my life
| Such a cruel twist of fate's dull knife
| 
| [Chorus]
