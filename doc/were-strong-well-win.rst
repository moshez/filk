| We marched on in, all sure and strong
| Our weapons at our side
| But ever since it all went wrong
| We try to run and hide
| 
| [Chorus]
| We're strong, we'll win -- that should be the law
| But by now we're all but beaten, and we'll settle for a draw
| We're strong, we'll win -- it shouldn't be so tough
| Quiet honestly we're sick of it, by now we've had enough
| 
| They wouldn't stop and wouldn't die
| And wouldn't lose, the knaves
| So we thought that we'll just say goodbye
| And go back to our faves
| 
| So finally they stopped the war
| And neither side did well
| We all grew tired of the gore
| And won't go back to hell
