If I Had a Brother
------------------

| I wanted to tell the story of Robin Hood from the point of view of King Richard's brother, left at home to manage the country.
| 
| TTTO "If I Had a Boat"
| 
| [Refrain]
| If I had a bro'
| Who'd rule this goddamn country
| And if he had a throne
| To rule this country from
| And we could all together
| Live in this great country
| Leading it to greatness in the world
| 
| If there were a robber
| I would go out and stop him
| I couldn't bring myself to letting him go free
| And though he helps the poor
| He helps them cheat on taxes
| And taxes help the country, I'm sure you will agree
| 
| [Refrain]
| 
| My brother went to the crusade
| He got himself religion
| Neglected home and country, sailed off with not a glance
| And if this country's lucky
| He'll not come back to haunt it
| Kiss my ass I rule here now
| You'll die upon a lance
| 
| [Refrain]
| 
| And if I could just rule here
| And get my freakin' taxes
| I think that I could do much, this country I'd improve
| But they're scared of Robin Hood and
| They're scared of all my taxes
| And I really need this money now, though you disapprove
| 
| [Refrain]
