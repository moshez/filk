I Got Me a Mac
--------------

| TTTO "Nishakti Bahura" by Mika Karney
| 
| Now everyone is going "this thing is just cute"
| But I'm a techie, and my judgement is astute
| Install, configure and make sure that you lock root --
| It used to be my only interest and pursuit
| Last night the Apple Store -- into my heart it hacked
| I couldn't help it, so I got me a Mac
| I got me a Mac
| 
| A man can never know what's in his own dreams
| I didn't think that I'd switch teams
| Oh my God, it's an iPod --
| I think my head will steam
| The screen I saw was looking shiny and it gleamed
| Last night the Apple Store -- into my heart it hacked
| I couldn't help it, so I got me a Mac
| I got me a Mac
| 
| They always looked expensive, PCs are just as good
| But then last night, I just decided not to brood
| And though it is closed source, Steve Jobs' forbidden fruit
| My heart is melted by the sound when it boots
| Last night the Apple Store -- into my heart it hacked
| I couldn't help it, so I got me a Mac
|
