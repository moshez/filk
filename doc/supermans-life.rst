Superman's Life
---------------

| TTTO "Eddie's Teddy" from RHPS
| 
| From the day he was born
| He was too strong
| For his folks didn't mourn
| 'Till he knew they died
| He grew up to be Clark
| He'd fight in the light or the dark
| He'd be on the good guys' side
| 
| On the day he grew up, all he wanted
| Was saving the planet, and all mankind
| He tried in vain, but it needed rescue again and again
| No rest for the saver he would find
| 
| [Chorus]
| When Clark Kent said his alien folks him sent
| You knew he was a Kryptonite
| But when he baked your pies, with those red-hot eyes
| Superman
| I'm his fan
| Modern knight
| 
| [Lex]
| Everyone adored him, I very nearly floored him
| I said here is my sweet plot, I know this is your weak spot
| Are green rocks that came to earth, from your home world
| 
| But when he escaped from his death trap
| He saved the whole earth, and he let loise die (What'd he say, what'd he say)
| I've gotta save Lois, I can't live without hearing her voice
| He turned time back, look at him fly!
| 
| [Chorus]
