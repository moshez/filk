Gave Up Too Soon
----------------

| TTTO "Spoke to Soon" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| Our lords and our ladies are craving the metals
| They all want the gold, every fop, knight and and dunce
| So the question is now: can we use all the lead here
| And the alchemists have now all started the hunt
| 
| [Chorus]
| We walk blind and desperate, pretending it's science
| Rewards are quite big though our chances our small
| Silver is nice, although Gold is our calling
| And lead is not worth it, not worth at all
| And to make gold from lead or to even make silver
| Would make us all famous, oh, it would be nice
| We're wise men of folly, in labs with our science
| We're wise men of folly, with gold to entice
| 
| We found a stone, and we think it's the answer
| We think that this stone will solve all of our plights
| Making it useful is just a formality
| But the doubters all say that we can't just be right
| 
| For we know that the rich folk have different agendas
| With all of the gold that they want they are born
| They spread lies, that we are just fooling about
| Now they are all wrong, but it won't stop the scorn
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| For the science of physics has proven us right now
| We finally have all that we have pursued
| Though men lost their minds and their wits and their bodies
| We're finally happy, we won't spoil the mood
| 
| It just takes some force and the atoms all shatter
| The protons, and neutrons, we'll change -- as we said
| The atoms we'll change to increase them in value
| "You see all this gold, well, it once was but lead
| Yes this gold, well, it once was but lead"
| 
| [Chorus]
