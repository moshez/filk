| 
| When the owl delivers the letter
| Will I show my dad he does not know better?
| I suggest an experiment — he can’t refuse
| Though I know that he thinks it's all a ruse
| 
| [Chorus]
| For he who knows both science and magic
| Will rule the world, I don’t know how well
| Will the end of my story be tragic?
| There’s no evidence yet to tell
| 
| [Bridge]
| I have made mistakes, I don’t know who to trust
| But the state of affairs just evokes disgust!
| There is wrong in the world, it is too unjust
| I must find the lever that I can adjust
| 
| With the Lord of Darkness defeated
| Will I find myself in his dark throne seated?
| For it is an old pattern, but is it real?
| Is there light inside me enough to heal?
| 
| [Chorus]
| Will I create a heaven or hell?
| There’s no evidence yet to tell!
