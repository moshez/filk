Blinkenlights
-------------

| TTTO "Shabat Baboker" by Arik Einstein
| 
| The switch's not letting packets through
| Why does it happen, not a clue
| The lights are blinking, off and on
| As though it's taken straight from "Tron"
| 
| You can try to do a reboot, disconnect and reconnect
| For a switch is just too simple, and it's too hard to inspect
| But no matter what I'm trying, the packets, still they drop
| And I'm contemplating
| Giving up
| And this troubleshooting
| Stop
