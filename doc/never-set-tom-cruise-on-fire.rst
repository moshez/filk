Never Set Tom Cruise on Fire
----------------------------

| In honor of "protest against Scientology" day, I'm doing my bit the best I know how -- by poking fun at them.
| 
| TTTO "Never set the cat on fire"
| 
| Never set Tom Cruise on fire, you only will annoy him
| And though he does so raise your ire, this surely won't destroy him
| Much better is to mock his stance, scientology is no advance
| No, never set Tom Cruise on fire
| 
| Refrain:
| And L. Ron Hubbard, these fools, to one, this man admire
| And never set Tom Cruise on fire
| 
| Dianetics is a foolish thing, so please be sure to leave it
| For once you have no sanity, you never will retrieve it
| And though you think your life's a mess, remember it has no success
| Dianetics is a foolish thing
| 
| [Refrain]
| 
| Don't believe their so-called data, it has now been refuted
| It's spouted off by mindless drones, some criticisms muted
| They don't want you to know what's true, for with your mind they want to screw
| Don't believe their so-called data
| 
| [Refrain]
| 
| Don't convert to this belief, it has no helpful uses
| When someone asks you 'what's it for?', you'll only make excuses
| For some real people have been hurt, I'm asking you to be alert!
| Don't convert to this belief
| 
| [Refrain]
| [Refrain]
