A Teen
------

| TTTO vixy&amp;Tony's "Thirteen"
| 
| Well, we had a kid a while ago, he was so cute when he would play
| Saw him growing up, so beutiful, we loved him more from day to day
| But the years piled on, not one day missed him, and now I cannot still pretend
| That kid has grown, he is no baby, he's now a teen at childhood's end
| 
| [Chorus]
| Please don't grow, a baby be
| Oh kid, won't you take some pity on me
| The devil himself couldn't cause more trouble
| So how can you be so mean?
| A teen, a teen, a teen, a teen
| 
| Oh, kid I can't tell where you're going, and you won't tell me where you've been
| A few years ago you were just a baby, who said adulthood could come in
| You disobey and you cause trouble, yet you still have on that cute grin
| This ain't war, this ain't a battle, you won't lose and we can't win
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I've given up, do what you want to, I can't control you anymore
| The leash is gone and you are free now, go forth now, the world explore
| I've given you all that I could now, I hope that you won't let me down
| But just remember this one thing now, you're still my kid, whenever I'm around
| 
| [Chorus]
