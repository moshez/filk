A Vorpal Sword
--------------

| TTTO "Norwegian Wood (This Bird has Flown)" by The Beatles
| 
| I once had a sword, or should I say, it once had me
| It would kill my foes, with well-placed blows, the battle flows
| 
| It made me bloodthirsty, and I started looking for fights
| And I battled constantly, during the days and the nights
| 
| I felt so controlled, my soul I sold, or so I'm told
| We killed left and right, for so it said, "It's time I fed"
| 
| It told me it owned me completely and started to laugh
| It told me if I would oppose it, I'd be cut in half
| 
| And when I broke free, it did kill me, left just debris
| So I went to hell, to you I tell, your soul don't sell
