Higher Tier
-----------

| TTTO "High Frontier", Echo's Children
| 
| I filed the ticket at the break of dawn:
| "My DNS is down and the network gone"
| And until they solve it, I'll just wait right here
| But it's escalated to a higher tier
| 
| [Chorus]
| I get these promises through the night --
| "Yes the problem handled, so please just hang tight"
| The problem's tricky, when it's done's not clear
| My ticket's handled by a higher tier
| 
| No matter how they tried, solutions they'd not found
| And I'm getting angry and the wall I pound!
| It would make things better if I had a beer
| For it's escalated to a higher tier
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| To solve my problem is a worthy task
| But I get no answers: "when it's done" I ask
| So now I watch the phone, and in my eye a tear:
| But it's escalated to a higher tier
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| All it really needed was a quick reboot
| But the guy who answered said had not root
| So I said "ok", quaking voice in fear
| To escalate it to higher tier
| 
| [Chorus]
