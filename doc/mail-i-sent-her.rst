Mail I Sent Her
---------------

| TTTO "Love Me Tender", Elvis Presely
| 
| Mail I sent her
| From the street
| "Do you want to go?"
| Download is by now complete
| Bandwidth was so low
| 
| Mail I sent her,
| "From" and "To"
| "With typing I am skilled
| Though I know, not well as you,
| Nor I ever will"
| 
| Mail I sent her,
| "From" too long
| It was filed as spam
| But the filing was so wrong
| Now I'm in a jam
| 
| Mail I sent her,
| From right here
| At 10 after nine
| It arrived in just a year
| That's too long a time
| 
| What at last, my mail comes through
| Darling, this I know
| Your address will be the "to"
| Though it might not show
