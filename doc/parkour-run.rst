Parkour Run
-----------

| TTTO Tom Smith's "Rocket Ride"
| 
| Where did you go, we've just begun
| We don't do no flips, just 'cause they're fun
| I'm on the wall now, sweety come on
| Please join me, baby, on a parkour run
| 
| How many drops must make a young man
| Before he breaks every bone
| How many jumps will he do when he can
| How loud will he later moan
| 
| How many monkey jumps over a bar
| Before we trip and we fall
| How will we know just how far
| Down we can jump and then roll
| 
| I want to make those precisions, rail to rail
| When you can't afford a mistake
| You have to pay attention to every detail
| Or you'll end up drenched in a lake
| 
| I want you to know when we get it done
| This ain't a competition, and we haven't won
| We'll keep on running in rain and sun
| Please join me, baby, on a parkour run
| 
| How many feet can you clear when you jump
| Is simply a matter of skill
| If you have perfect form, and you aren't a chump
| It's simply a matter of will
| 
| How many techniques will be mastered today
| By practinging until we keel
| And with those we don't, much to our dismay
| Well, we'll have to learn how to deal
| 
| I used to be go out of breath, my muscles they'd cramp
| Every time I went running up on a ramp
| Now I'm doing ok, I'm in much better shape
| And someday I'm gonna get it all on tape
| 
| We have no belts, of hierarchy none
| All forms of distinction we explicitly shun
| We just start running and go on and on
| Please join me, baby, on a parkour run
| Please join me, baby, on a parkour run
| 
| Kong jumps, turn jumps, lazy boys, and much more
| Lots of things to know how to do
| Learn them, practice more, and please get up from the floor
| The bruises will be both black and blue
| 
| I want more than flashy and great looking tricks
| They're just a way of impressing chicks
| A traceur and not an acrobat
| A traceuess that can jump like a cat
| 
| I want to scale that wall and to climb the tree
| I want to be able to feel free
| The joy and wonder as I head out there,
| And I know I can have it, if I only dare.
| 
| How many story hound journalist fucks
| Will make up stories to scare
| How many more of all these schmuks
| Really expect us to care?
| 
| How many stupid stories of guys
| Who break their heads of their jaws
| How many exaggerations or lies
| About people who live for applause
| 
| I want to cruise the neighbourhood, jumping around
| And feel no longer tied to the ground
| I want to boldly run where nobody went
| And I want to jump higher than Clark Kent
| 
| Where did you go, we've just begun
| We don't do no flips, just 'cause they're fun
| I'm on the wall now, sweety come on
| Please join me, baby, on a parkour run
