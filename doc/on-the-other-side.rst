On the Other Side
-----------------

| TTTO "בשדה ירוק" by Dany Sanderson
| 
| [Chorus]
| On the other side of the looking glass
| On the other side, there is now a lass
| On the other side of the looking glass
| Where the kings can't rule but all the pawns can pass
| 
| It is black and white, there is no gray
| And now Alice must choose a side
| She will start to go on her own way
| But the first part is fast, she's going on a ride
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| What's the name of the name of the label?
| Does it matter at all to the song,
| Which has plot-holes the size of a table
| Though when Humpty objects, you better nod along
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Step by step, the quest she has finished
| And the crown is put on her head
| But her age cannot be diminished
| She will grow older and older until the day she's dead
| 
| Now her blameless cat gets the scolding
| For no cat can be ever to blame
| Not too long will her anger be holding
| And the cat won't confess it had a red queen's fame
| 
| On the other side of the looking glass
| On the other side, there's no more a lass
| On the other side of the looking glass
| Where the queens don't rule but all the pawns can pass
| 
| On the other side of the looking glass
| On the other side, there's no more a lass
| On the other side of the looking glass
| Where the queens don't rule but all the pawns can pass
