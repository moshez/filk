| When we got on the internet, we saw this cool new site
| Where you could search all that you care, and it would get it right
| But it seems it had limits to its hospitality
| It sure was not prepared to cater hackers such as we
| 
| [Chorus]
| And we're banned from Google, everyone
| Banned from Google, and now searching isn't fun
| It seems the things that we did  violated T-O-S
| And now we hang our heads with shame, it wasn't a success
| 
| When we started running load tests, just to see how it will go
| We should have known right then that it will be a tale of woe
| They blocked our address right then, and sent us their complaint
| And when our lawyers read this they were so shocked they could faint
| 
| We tried to use Gmail-F-S to host our data far
| But we did not read the small print, it is a thing they bar
| Though all our data is right there, to us it is denied
| When we lost all our mp3s we pouted and we cried
| 
| We're now the best at surfing, but our seaching kind of blows
| We've done the crime and now the time, it's just life I suppose
| We're sorry about the banning and the hacking and the fuss
| At least we're sure that Google won't be quick forgetting us!
| 
| [Chorus]
| 'Cause we're saved in Google, everyone
| Saved in Google, and the record won't be gone
| A hundred years or more, I know, it will be kept in there
| But if you've not a thing to hide, we're sure that you won't care
