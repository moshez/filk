Call my cell

| A man drives down the street
| He says why am I lost in the middle now
| Why am I lost in the middle
| Reading a map is so hard
| I need some good directions
| I want a piece of advice
| Don't want to end up in circles
| Burning my gas out
| Gas meter, gas meter
| Running on empty
| Far away from well-lit home
| Mr. honking horn, honking horn
| Don't honk your horn at me
| You know I don't find the street
| Where I should have made a right
| 
| [Chorus]
| If you'll be available
| I can be your G-P-S
| I can call you Betty
| And Betty when you call me
| You can call my cell
| 
| A man drives down the street
| He says why do I get no signal
| One little bar of signal
| And woe my calls are so long
| Talking to wife and family
| What if it dies here
| Who'll be my cell phone
| Now that the battery has
| Died died
| Too far away from antenna
| With no connection whatsoever
| All alone alone
| There were disconnections in the middle
| There were lost phone calls disconnecting
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| A man drives down the street
| It's a street in a strange world
| Maybe it's the first world
| Maybe it's a strange part of town
| He doesn't know the street names
| He folds no maps of this place
| He is a foreign man
| He is surrounded by the sound
| The sound
| [spoken]
| In one thousand meters, make a right
| Then keep left
| He looks around, around
| He sees street names on the signs
| He turns right and hellelujah --
| 
| [Chorus]
