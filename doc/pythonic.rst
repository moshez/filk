| Jane Mailander has a song called "Pythonic" about Monty Python TTTO "Ironic". I thought this has to be written:
| 
| Original: Ironic (Alanis Morisette)
| 
| <a name="cutid1"></a>
| A Dutch man, with a brand new OS
| He wrote a language for it, from scratch more or less
| So he borrowed a name from a comedy troup
| And he stole some ideas from an academy group
| And isn't it Pythonic...don't you think
| 
| [Chorus]
| It's like code so clear, you just know what it means
| It's just objects at work 'cause we don't need no beans
| It's the one way to do it because we don't need two
| And wouldn't you know, it's Guido
| 
| Its structure's determined by spaces and tabs
| It was proved to be better by testing in labs
| The block-starting colon -- it's there to be clear
| The language's so pretty, without any peer
| And wouldn't you know, it's Guido
| 
| [Chorus]
| Well the library has a funny way of having it all
| When you think you will have to code and having to do it by yourself
| And the library has a funny way of just being dumb
| When you think it's got it all it'll just go blowing up
| In your face
| 
| Some metaclasses when you need them that bad
| Some generators for flow that is mad
| It's like ten ways to do it but one is the best
| It's learning just what you need,
| And then learning all of the rest
| And isn't it Pythonic...don't you think
| Almost too Pythonic...and, yeah, I really do think...
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The library has a funny way of having it all
| The library has a funny, funny way of just blowing up
| Just blowing up
