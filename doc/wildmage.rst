| 
| Based on "The Outstreched Shadow" by Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory.
| 
| Welcome dear brother, though you know me not
| We will go now the world to explore
| It's not your fault that of me you forgot
| Memories are not your core
| 
| [Chorus]
| Brother, you've joined me
| Together we'll be
| Now from our past we are free
| Forest and wilderness, here is our home
| Nature is ours to roam
| 
| Cast with me spells and learn how to use
| The power that you hold inside
| It's up to you now, what will you choose
| The law is no longer your guide
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| You have run far but your quest is not done
| Now you must save all this land 
| Though battle's ended, the war is not won
| Together, in this fight, we stand
| 
| [Chorus]
