| I beamed down to this planet with a phaser in my hand,
| But I've got this feeling suddenly that this might be the end
| I wore this shirt, the color's red
| The planet, it was strange
| But now I fear I might be dead
| My fate I cannot change
| 
| [Chorus]
| I'm a red shirt, I die when we all land
| I'm speared or shot or mangled,
| And my red blood stains the sand
| 
| I had a dream the other night,
| When we were all aboard
| I thought I heard them call me to me
| "This planet's unexplored
| We need you to go down there
| But you won't be alone
| The officers will be with you"
| The comlink did so drone
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I soon will be in paradise
| And then I'll look all 'round
| And then I see the officers
| Still safe upon the ground
| These monsters though they killed me
| Are now their friends you see
| Although I'm dead and buried
| They sure won't cry for me
| 
| [Chorus]
