I Think I'm a Zombie
--------------------

| TTTO "I Think We're Alone Now"
| 
| What I most crave --
| Is human flesh and some brain matter
| So, you think you'll pray?
| You don't understand
| And so I'm
| 
| [Chorus]
| Shambling just as fast as I can
| Walking with my outreaching hands
| Tryin' to get away from the light
| And then I feel my friends around me
| As we slowly gain some ground
| So it's OK
| 
| I think I'm a zombie
| I'm biting on a brain in a skull I found --
| I think I'm a zombie
| The shrieking of the crowds is the loudest sound
| 
| Look at the way
| The shot-guns are kow-pow-powin'
| At night-time or day
| Tearing' me through
| And so we're --
| 
| [Chorus]
