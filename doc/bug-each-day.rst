Bug Each Day
------------

| TTTO "יש לי יום יום חג" by הגשש החיוור
| 
| When software's done, it is supported
| Beneath this effort I cannot bow
| And I can fix each bug that's been reported
| And that, my friend, is what I'll do now
| 
| [Chorus]
| For each day a bug
| And a bug each day
| For each day a bug
| I'm telling ya'
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| The bugs I get, each one, is special some way
| For each of them is funny and it's sad
| And one by one, each bug, you will see me slay
| And that, my friend, is not too bad
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| One summer day, when things were looking quiet
| I knew that it cannot be thus for long
| And I was right, you know, it was a riot
| That day, my friend, it all went wrong
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I'm telling ya, it's hard work and it's fun still
| I'm telling ya, my friend, I'm still right here
| I'm telling ya, you know, it's such a big thrill
| I'm telling ya, it's not as dull, as it appears
| 
| [Chorus]
