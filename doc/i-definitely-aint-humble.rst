I Definitely Ain't Humble
-------------------------

| TTTO "At Least I Ain't Humble" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| When you get to my home address
| You ask for my plans and I confess
| I'm always tempted to reveal them all to you
| What I can say, it's what we villains tend to  do
| 
| I know I'm evil, but it ain't my fault
| It's only the way that up I was brought
| So when the devil gives me ideas and some advice
| I just take my chances, pray and then roll the dice
| <blockquote>I used to be so upset when
| My plans would fail and go south
| I'll never come to terms with
| How the heroes snuff my plans out</blockquote>
| So when I've been eight kinds of moron I
| Just wait for plan nine to say my goodbye
| I can't resist it, so I don't pout and sulk
| When I buy all my stuff from ACME I do it in bulk
| 
| Of self-improvement I'm no fan
| Doesn't mesh with all my evil plans
| I just alternate admitting them and denial
| Though I won't give up, I try to be evil with a smile
| Though I won't give up, I try to be evil with a smile
