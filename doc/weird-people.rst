Weird People
------------

| TTTO "Short People" by Randy Newman
| 
| Weird people are not normal
| Weird people are not normal
| Weird people are not normal
| At all
| 
| They do strange old things
| And act insane
| They can be good friends
| Or they can be your bane
| They got weird hobbies
| And stranger hobbies still
| They go to conventions
| Where they're rarely keeping still
| 
| Well, I like some weird people
| I like some weird people
| 'Round me
| 
| Weird people are not the same
| As everyone
| (They're not anyone)
| All men are a little weird
| Until they're gone
| (It's a wonderful world)
| 
| Weird People got nobody
| Weird People got nobody
| Weird People got nobody
| To ape
| 
| They got tastes that are unique
| And they just don't care
| You gotta not be scared
| If you want to share
| They go to bumper cars
| Going beep beep beep
| They stay up all night
| And not sleep sleep sleep
| They got strange hygienic habbits
| And they sometimes smell
| But when you know them they are kinda swell
| Well, I want some weird people
| I want some weird people
| I want some weird people
| 'Round me
