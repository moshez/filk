Code Crunch Song
----------------

| TTTO "Banana Boat Song" (traditional, Harry Belafonte version)
| 
| Code-o, Code-o
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Code, me say code, me say code, me say code
| Me say code, me say code-o
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| Work all night on drink of a coke
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| My fingers aching and my back is broke
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| Come, Mr. G plus plus, read my code already
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Come, Mr. G plus plus, read my code already
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| Write six-nest, seven-nest, eight-nest for
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Six-nest, seven-nest, eight-nest for
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| Code-o, Code-o
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Code, me say code, me say code, me say code
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| A beautiful bunch of lightweight objects
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Hide the deadly coding defects
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| Write six-nest, seven-nest, eight-nest for
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Six-nest, seven-nest, eight-nest for
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| 
| Code-o, Code-o
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
| Code, me say code, me say code, me say code
| Coding's done and me wait for compile
