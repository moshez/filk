Patience of a Programmer

| TTTO "Temper of Revenge" by Julia Ecklar
| 
| I was sworn to fix now this giant source
| Though the bugs in it were not a few
| It is needed today, so the customer cried
| They told me, "it is up to you"
| 
| I started at noon, compiled the code
| Saved a change and once more to compile
| A mistake I made, it was simple to see
| And the errors and warnings would pile
| 
| The clock went on, my task did not
| The bugs, to the last, were all there
| The deadline loomed, it has made me afraid
| All I do is just tear out my hair
| 
| [Chorus]
| So find me a prompt, as bright as the sun
| Find me a shell that will make the code run
| I will program 'till dawn, 'till the sun's in the sky
| Though each time that I run it, anew it will die
| 
| Bring me "e d", perhaps "v i"
| Whenever it breaks I will let out a cry
| I will patch it and change it 'till I will grow old
| For this feature was already sold
| 
| I've been on this issue for day and night
| The moon has rose, soon it will set
| I'm out of my wits, I don't know what to do
| And the bugs -- I have not fixed them yet
| 
| Who wrote this crap, a man or beast
| It was surely no rational soul
| I know this was done to offend me and mine
| To frustrate me -- that was the goal
| 
| I will make this thing work, I promise now
| A promise I make with my heart
| Though it kill me yet, or my sanity flee
| Or my mind, be it sundered apart
| 
| [Chorus]
