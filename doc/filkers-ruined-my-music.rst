| Listener, oh listener
| We live in trying times
| These days it seems that nothing's safe
| No refuge can we find
| Parody tainted all our stuff
| Stained it with silly hues
| And that's the reason why my music's
| Unlistenable to you
| 
| [Chorus]
| Filkers ruined my music
| I swear to God it's true
| Bob and Terence killed up my song tunes
| Would I lie to you
| They rewrote all the lyrics
| But left a word intact
| Yes, filkers ruined my music
| I swear to God it's true
| 
| I'd finished up the last few notes
| And uploaded the song
| When I saw the bandwidth rising
| I knew it will go wrong
| The lyrics were soon posted
| A web site we all know
| Which seems to have some evil songs
| And the humour, it is low
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Surrounded by those fearsome songs
| I had no place to flee
| May Cthulu drive them all insane
| When rising from the sea
| When I wrote about them in my blog
| I felt like I had won
| But they just took my words and tunes
| And mashed them into one
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Yes, filkers ruined my music
| Really, would I lie to you?
