| Way back in ancient Rome, if you could take a look
| Children did all that they wanted, and everyone wrote a book
| It is the same in this age too, society's going to the dogs
| Children act the same way, and everyone's writing blogs
| 
| And it's blogs, blogs, blogs, blogs
| Blogs, blogs, BLOGS
| There's always some more blogs
| 
| A web site used to take work, now it's all a snap
| Any fool can click and write one, no matter if it's crap
| The contents are not clever, or interesting or true
| Any idiot can do it, and ninety nine percent do
| 
| So if you care about nature, if you don't want to cut trees
| But you still feel that there's someone whom your writing would please
| Then you'll want to write a new blog, find a dead horse to flog
| Write endless tirades of ranting -- or just put lyrics up in your blog
