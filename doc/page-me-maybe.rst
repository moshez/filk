Page Me Maybe
=============
(TTTO Call Me Maybe)


The site was up, now it fell,
Don't ask me why, I can't tell,
We've got an outage from hell,
And now it's ruined my day

I got the page, now I wish
I wasn't looking at this
They say ignorance bliss,
So knowledge ruined my day

The site is not loading,
Good things it's not boding,
Crashes, sloppy coding,
This outage is getting scary

[Chorus]
Hey, now, here's my pager -- I always carry,
And I'm the on-call, it beeped -- it's scary
It's hard to wake up, my eyes are weary
But I'm the on-call, it beeped -- it's scary

You took your time with the call
It's been a while since nightfall
I'm tired, can't think at all
But I can't wait 'till day

I hoped it was no big deal,
Maybe a blip -- no it's real
The site is gone, and I feel
It's gonna ruin my day

Metrics quickly falling
All queues, backed and slowin'
Midnight, problem growin'
How did the dashboard get so scary?

[Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Before you paged me late at night,
It wasn't so bad,
It wasn't so bad,
It wasn't so so bad,
Before you paged me late at night
It wasn't so bad,
It wasn't so bad,
It wasn't so so bad,
Before you paged me late at night
Before you came into my life
It wasn't so bad,
And you should know that
It wasn't so bad,
It's hard to look at the alert, it's scary

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Your beeps, they're scary
