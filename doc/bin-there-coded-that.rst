| I had regular expressions and I thought that I'd use Perl
| But with at, bang, hash and dollar, when I look at it I hurl
| When I woke up the next morning, and I tried to hack the code
| I decided I can't do it, and it's time to hit the road
| 
| Chorus:
| Bin there, dun that, learned when I should leave
| Got the conference's t-shirt, and the other stuff they give
| Yes, I bin there, dun that, learned to how to indent
| So now I code in Python and that's how I pay my rent
| 
| The CEO demanded that our language be the same
| As what everyone is using, and no matter if it's lame
| So now all our work is Java, and the code is enterprise
| But we tried to scale it up and we were in for a surprise
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| C plus plus is oriented, to objects, so they say
| Just ask Alan Kay about it, he'll explain it's not the way
| And when your code is full of templates, the compiler laughs at you
| 'Cause the messages you get can be encoded jibb'rish goo
| 
| [Chorus]
| Those old parenthic languages, they got no sense of style
| You just write the AST trees, it gets old after a while
| And with Lispish reader macros, code can change before you blink
| When you try to read it later, it does not mean what you think
| 
| [Chorus]
