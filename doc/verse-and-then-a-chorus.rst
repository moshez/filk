Verse and then a Chorus
-----------------------

| TTTO "Planet with a Forest" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| Dear audience, have you put down your coffee
| Are you sitting down, are you calm?
| For I must announce an exciting discovery
| Of lyrics for this CD-ROM
| 
|  It's a verse and -- then a chorus!
|  See I told you - exciting and new
|  And not just any old chorus
|  Like the last three hundred and seventy two
| 
| I know what you're thinking, this is all so familiar 
| They just wrote some new words to the score
| But I think when you've heard my next startling disclosure
| You'll know it's not what you heard before
| 
|  There's some changes -- in the chorus
|  It has hastily-made wooden rhymes
|  And friends, you're not gonna believe this --
|  I have yet to commit some more crimes
| 
|  In that verse -- that has a chorus
|  It's as novel as novel can be
|  It's not just any old chorus
|  Like the last three hundred and seventy three! 
| 
| You know, I am starting to have my suspicions 
| That we're not in a new parody
| Though the lyrics we had, they were just downloaded
| The tune -- well it begs to be free
| 
|  Of the verse -- and then a chorus
|  Who could ask for anything more
|  And it's not just any old chorus
|  Like the last three hundred and seventy four
| 
|  It's a verse -- and then a chorus
|  Proving that novelty thrives 
|  It's not just any old chorus
|  Like the last three hundred and seventy five
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| I'm just throwing one more to the mix
| And not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and seventy six
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| Now this one is totally mine
| It's not just any old chorus
| Like the last thirteen, times twenty nine
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| You see it's determined by fate
| To be not any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and seventy eight
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| So delicious you will want to dine
| It's not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and seventy nine
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| If I got here, I should be a hero
| For it's not any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty -- and zero?
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| Though I know you all wish I were done
| For it's not any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty one
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| Now this should be sung by you too --
| It's not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty two
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| Though it nowhere should mention a tree
| It's not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty three
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| And you surely can't call this a bore
| It's not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty four
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| It's a wonder I've made it alive
| Since it's not any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty five
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| I see nothing that's wrong here to fix
| It's not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty six
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| Like Spinal Tap, it goes up to eleven
| And not just any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty seven
| 
| It's a verse -- and then a chorus
| Though by now I've incurred all your hate
| Though it's not any old chorus
| Like the last three hundred and eighty eight
