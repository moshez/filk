`Laura Shigihara's Poo Sea Shanty <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5SfwlI3GU>`_

| "Just take a cruise," they told me,
| "Away from all your woes,
| The sea is fine, you'll feel relaxed
| from head down to your toes"
| 
| The cruise was booked and paid for,
| And I got on the boat
| The winds were strong, the waves were high,
| And I lost all my oats!
| 
| Chorus:
| On no, I'm feeling sick
| I cannot keep food down
| But if I lean far overboard
| I'll fall off and I'll drown
|
| There are so many tricks, now,
| To fight the need to spew 
| I've tried them all and they don't work
| So stop, I beg of you
| 
| This cruise will end one day and
| I'll finally eat again
| Until that day, just leave me be,
| To hurl and then complain
| 
| Chorus:
| On no, I'm feeling sick
| I cannot keep food down
| But if I lean far overboard
| I'll fall off and I'll drown
