Property Destruction
--------------------

| TTTO "Maoz Tsur" (Jewish traditional)
| 
| Oh my god the warranty
| Is out of date, and we're out of luck
| I can say with certainty
| That vacuum cleaner just won't suck
| For so the lightning bolt struck,
| So outside it will be chucked
| Out the door,
| So far, and more
| Fixing it ain't worth a buck
| 
| I fail to pout, will not cry
| As all the lights now start to dim
| The lightning bolt -- it seems it fried
| The fuses -- blown to bits and limbs
| The situation looked grim
| So I've asked for help from Tim
| House now burns
| You live, you learn
| And next time I won't ask him
