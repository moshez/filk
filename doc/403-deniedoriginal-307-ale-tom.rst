| When you surf on the web, me lads, on every site that's new
| There's 500 internal, 404 not found and the good old 502
| There's 302 and 301 and 300 (is hard to find)
| But I think the most annoying one is 403 denied
| 
| 403 denied, me lads, 403 denied
| The most annoying error that on the web you'll find
| It says the file is there but that the web server is blind
| 403 denied
| 
| It started out down in CERN, when a file could not be read
| And TBL just had to know it's not the file is dead
| He came up with this brand new code, which spells out "I refuse...
| For trying to authenticate, you'll only get abuse."
| 
| (chorus)
| 
| They needed to distinguish it from 401 "who's you?"
| Which means that if you know the code, then you could get value
| But with that god-damn 403, you're left without recourse
| Unless it is to vent the rage in poorly-written verse
| 
| (chorus)
| 
| Now when you surf, and get a link and click it hopefully
| If the admin that worked on it put permissions carelessly
| He made it chmod'ed -r for the apache group
| And now it's worth less than a pile of icky oozing goop
| 
| (chorus)
| 
| (slower)
| There's many error codes, me lads, but this one beats them all:
| "I have the file, you see, but you're just talking to a wall --
| It won't help to authenticate, won't do to try again,
| And if you bash the keyboard it will only cause you pain."
| 
| (final chorus)
| 403 denied, me lads, 403 denied
| The most annoying error that on the web you'll find
| It says the file is there but that the web server is blind
| It riles and it chafes, for the file, it's just there,
| But that mean old server won't give a care
| It's good the error is so rare
| 403 denied
