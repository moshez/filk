The Moon and the Sun
--------------------

| TTTO "Layla Layla"
| 
| Every night the moon is shining from above
| Giving us its tender rays of peace and love
| Man to man is wolf, you know
| As he kills with tooth and claw
| When the night is shining down from above
| 
| Every day the sun is shining in the sky
| Giving us the will to live and not to die
| Turns the vampires into dust
| Like a stake that's through heart thrust
| When the sun is shining brightly in the sky
