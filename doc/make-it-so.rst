| [Chorus]
| Make it so, make it so, these words hold us all in wonder
| When we fight or flee or travel; make it so,  and go
| For it speaks to us of planning, and we know there'll be no blunder
| We are sure to be make it safely if we only make it so
| 
| Now you lead a starfleet flagship and of that there's no refuting
| In the face of sure destruction, we all know that you'll stay calm
| When the plot picks up its pace and we expect to see some shooting
| Of some science fiction weapons, and perhaps a fusion bomb
| 
| So we rise up from the floor and see our shields are almost down
| Now I know your captain's instincts will make sure we see it through
| But I'd like for you to know that you can change the words around
| For by now we have all got it, and we can recite it true
