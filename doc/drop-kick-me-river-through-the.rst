Drop Kick Me, River, Through the Darkness of Space
--------------------------------------------------

| TTTO "Drop Kick Me, Jesus, Through the Goalposts of Life"
| 
| [Chorus]
| Drop kick me River through the darkness of space
| Kick to the shin and a punch to the face
| Turn, spin and jump with that rarest of grace
| Drop kick me River through the darkness of space
| 
| Take me, oh take me, I need you, oh damn
| My love is true -- read my mind, it's no sham
| Punch me up high, just don't kick me below
| I’ve got the will, River, you’ve got the toe.
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Take on the reavers as you did before
| Don't let a single one through the door
| I'm always yours if you'll always be mine
| When you kick and twirl, I can see the divine
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| [Chorus]
