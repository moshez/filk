| The horns beeps in the morning make a loud annoying sound
| In the lane that's to my right an empty place I found
| As I swerve too fast I almost crash, but I still can keep my speed
| To get to work on time -- that is my sole need
| 
| Chorus:
| Must hurry, must hurry now,
| Overtake from the left, overtake from the right
| Must hurry, must hurry now,
| Swerve into lanes when the margin is tight
| Must hurry, must hurry now,
| If I lose a minute, I have lost a way
| Must hurry, must hurry now
| And the office is so far and away
| 
| (chorus)
| 
| We crest the hill and see a huge jam by the shore
| Pass the signpost for a speed that's not helpful anymore
| We made such good speed so far, but now we drive so slow
| And the time when I had to be at work is now so long ago
| 
| (chorus)
| 
| I try to take a shortcut, but it looks like so have they,
| And if I will not be at work, there will be hell to pay
| Though our labour is of burden beasts, our speed is that of snails
| We drive slow in the traffic on the roads and on the trails
| 
| (chorus)
| 
| Papa tells me to take care, but this driving's all I've known
| Still I wonder what it's like to call the zen monk's calm your own
| To avoid the honks and anger, not try to win that race
| But it's hard not to get angry when you move at such a pace
