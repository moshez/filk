NASA's Engineers
----------------

| TTTO "Barret's Privateers", Stan Rogers
| 
| Oh, the year was 2021
| How I wish I was in space right now
| When we begun to leave for space
| But I was left here in this place
| 
| God damn them all!
| I was told, "ah, space is dark and space is cold,
| Safe from our woes and from our fears,
| You will stay here for ten more years,
| The last of NASA's engineers"
| 
| Oh, chief director called for men,
| How I wish I was in space right now
| Who'll man the station when they're gone
| It seems I was the only one
| 
| God damn...
| 
| We had a party when they left
| How I wish...
| They wished me well, and said goodbye
| And said "for us oh don't you cry"
| 
| God damn...
| 
| I do my job, and hold the line
| How I wish...
| And watch the stars by day or night
| When it is dark and when it's light
| 
| God damn...
| 
| The ships now circle up above
| How I wish...
| As they now learn to live up there
| 'Cycling water and the air
| 
| God damn...
| 
| I've had to hear their stories told,
| How I wish...
| Of explorations, of brave deeds
| And deep inside my heart would bleed
| 
| God damn...
| 
| There's been no signal now for days,
| How I wish...
| I've been so bored I wrote this song
| And soon I hope I'll go along
| 
| God damn...
| 
| So here I lay in my 33rd year,
| How I wish...
| It's been ten years since they sailed away
| And I'm gonna leave for space today
| 
| Oh, thank the Lord,
| I was told that space is dark and space is cold
| But now I'm shedding joyful tears,
| The last of NASA's engineers
| God damn...
