| Don't call my cell in battle my sweet dear
| Do not expect me when you see the enemies come near
| For when you're in a fight I'll stay away
| I will not come to your help, but perhaps another may
| 
| Don't call my cell in battle -- fight instead
| Or choose to flee, but calling me will only get you dead
| For when you are surrounded by your foes
| It's not the time to call me and it's not the time to doze
| 
| Don't call my cell in battle - wait a bit
| For calling me would show that you do not have any wit
| Wait with the call until you go back home
| Avoid the cell phone charges that will happen when you roam
