My Guitar
---------

| Tune: original
| 
| Inspired by Vixy&amp;Tony's "Six String Love"
| 
| I like to play on my guitar, I guess I'm not alone
| It's fun to play when I'm with friends, it's fun just on my own
| I like to practice chords I know, I like to learn some more
| For playing just the power chords can make you such a bore
| 
| For when I play, the people near, they tend to look at me
| And since I like attention, it is just my cup of tea
| I like it when they stare, and I still like it when they gawk
| It's fun when they are silent, but I don't mind when they talk
| 
| [Chorus]
| My guitar, she is so light,
| And my guitar she is so mine
| For me alone she is so right
| I just adore her slick design
| 
| My air guitar is never wrong, it's rare she's out of tune
| To breakage and string snapping, I'm so lucky she's immune
| It's air that she is made of, and it's air on which I play
| The sounds she is making, well, inside my head they stay
| 
| [Chorus]
