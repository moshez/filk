| As we were lookin' for a job to keep us going
| We saw a radar blip, and a spaceship it was showing
| We first brought in Jayne, and then we brought in Zoe
| For looting may be a crime, but it gets us somewhat dough-ey
| 
| Chorus:
| Dong ma, bao bay, dong ma
| Fly for the daddy 'ol
| Fly for the daddy 'ol
| There's protein in the jar
| 
| We counted out our loot and it made a hefty booty
| To take it all and sell it, well we felt it is our duty
| We felt all warm and happy, for we could keep on flying
| But the devil take the union, in all things they are prying
| 
| We had to have our Kaylee for to the bomb it was a-tickin'
| The reavers booby-trapped the thing, we were gonna take a lickin'
| But now just as we were free, and were gonna be rewarded
| The union ship that spotted us said "please stop and be boarded"
| 
| T'was black in space as always, and the troops entered our haven
| All mil'try-like and official, and their faces they were shaven
| We showed them in with welcome, all 'cept Simon and his sister
| She was wanted by the union, and we made sure that they missed her
| 
| Now nobody can aid us, but Mal can save the captain
| But Mal saved his life when he thought his death was certain
| And so the captain freed us, but our booty he impounded
| His "civilized" ideas -- they left us all confounded
| 
| Now there's some take delight in the fightin' and the punching
| And others take delight in the fine food they are munching
| But I take delight in the spaceship that I'm flying
| Cross my heart and hope to die, for of that I'll not be lying
