God of Rain

| Once I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| Oh, my unbeatable stormy weather (now it is very dry)
| I'm telling you I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| Now I'm wearing a coat of Leather
| 
| 1 2 3 4
| 
| Divinity, being the lord was me
| Politics on Mount Olympus, inventing morality
| Or smiting people for the volume of their snore
| Giving the rules, and smiting people who could not follow them anymore
| 
| Once I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| A pantheon, well, that was my home (now it is very dry)
| I'm telling you I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| And I huddle beneath the SkyDome (once he was the God of Rain) 
| 
| I can't wait, I'm raising the water rates, I'm worshipped
| "God, please make the rain not flood us,
| There's a leak in the roof, oh sad is our fate"
| It's more than fair, not that I really care
| Let's drop some more rain in Europe
| And see all the ladies drying their hair
| 
| Once I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| Hey Jesus, Muhammad, Got problems? You phone me! (now it is very dry)
| I'm telling you I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| Now the rains will not come, until I will be free (once he was the God of Rain)
| 
| Now some of you are probably wondering how I came to be mortal on earth here
| after divinity in Heaven. Should I tell them, guys?
| Tell us, God!
| 
| You see late one night when the Gods were all asleep
| Down to earth I came, and my godly bride I did ditch
| At which point the other Gods, who did not care much for me
| Closed gates, and back I can't reach!
| God, now mortal, don't you dare chortle
| They closed the gate and barred up the portal
| Not of my own volition, I had to change my position
| So next time, you hate all things divine
| Remember: to him you are like a cow
| The God of Rain doesn't care now! 
| 
| Once I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| I was looking for ways to kill people by drowining (now it is very dry)
| I'm telling you I was the God of Rain (now it is very dry)
| And now I'm stuck here in accounting (once he was the God of Rain)
