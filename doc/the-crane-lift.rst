| In my life, I quest for power
| So the people say to me
| Living life, that's well and good
| But power is the key
| If there's balance to my power
| Then it's simply not enough
| My dears, I must have power
| And I must be strong and tough
| 
| For power is its own reward
| When you smite who you will
| You don't have to be responsible
| But with power, comes the bill
| 
| As I gather up my power,
| There are those who like it not
| They think it might be dangerous
| But I smite them, a lot
| There is much fun in the power
| When it's used without remorse
| But then I get so hungry
| That I could eat a horse
| 
| For power out of fairy tales
| Of evils lords who rule
| Is what I want, and all I want
| 'Cause power is so cool
