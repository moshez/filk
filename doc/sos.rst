SOS
---

| Tune: original
| 
| In my mind's eye there's a passage
| It's a hallway on a ship
| And I'm sure it is a message,
| Clue or tip
| 
| [Chorus]
| When the water level's rising, there is nothing I can do
| We are going down under, all the passsengers and crew
| And I'm sending out a signal, it's a message of distress
| I am tapping dots and dashes -- S.O.S.
| 
| It's a symbol, it's a stand-in
| It's an icon, a disguise
| I have gotten understanding
| Of those cries
| 
| [Bridge]
| When you figure out solutions then the story has to end
| But there is just this one message I must send
| 
| So farewell, oh, world, I'm leaving
| But before I say goodbye
| In the midst of all the grieving
| I found why
| 
| [Chorus]
