| I think the memory is almost gone
| And my time with you is almost done
| The OOM killer is looking to act
| And the kill -9 is almost a fact
| 
| I know we have been connected by pipe
| I gave you a string of an unknown type
| But my memory's corruprdted and filled with crap
| And with SIG 11 I'm gonna be slapped
| 
| [Chorus]
| So remember you promised not to crash
| Even if the data has turned to trash
| Recover from errors and note them down
| In your logfile
| 
| I wanted to know all there is to know
| But the brk(), it refused to grow
| So the xmalloc carped and now I'm dead
| It would not return a NULL instead
| 
| I think the memory is almost gone
| And my time with you is almost done
| But my memory's corrupted and filled with crap
| And with SIG 11 I'm gonna be slapped
| 
| [Chorus]
