Filker in the Con

| TTTO "Create of the Wood", by Heather Alexander
| 
| I am a filker in the con
| With all the fen that from hell spawn
| My song is weird, it is your bane
| My song can drive a man insane
| So sing with me, or a tune play
| We will be here, till break of day
| 
| And I shall write more filk songs
| 
| We've been in place since cons began
| We're just like you, we're mortal men
| We write the lyrics, skills we hone
| The tunes we steal or make our own
| 
| And I shall write more filk songs
| 
| Come sit with us, you fellow fen
| Sing songs we wrote, and more to pen
| Some sing of laughter, some of pain
| Write a good ose, respect you'll gain
| We'll write a rhyme to match a line
| About an elf, or a feline
| 
| And I shall write more filk songs
| 
| Sweet songs I'll write for thee alone
| Sweet tunes I stole, and some are known
| I'll write some more, I'll improvise
| I'll sing some songs that you despise
| The song I killed, I'll kill again
| I write some rhymes past mortal ken
| 
| Lalala....
| 
| We've played some music that you know
| And some you don't, but please don't go
| We'll give you CDs with our stuff
| If what you hear is not enough
| The silence here will last long
| For quiet here, it feels so wrong
| 
| So sing no quarter, yell with us
| Or sing "The March of Cambreadth"
| We'll bring the walls down with our voice
| You'll sing with us you'll have no choice
| We'll sing some songs that have a ban
| Or parodies that hardly scan
| 
| And I shall write more filk songs
| 
| I am a filker in the con
| With all the fen that from hell spawn
| My song is weird, it is your bane
| My song can drive a man insane
| So sing with me, or a tune play
| We will be here, till break of day
| 
| And I shall write more filk songs
