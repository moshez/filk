| Outside the world we live in
| There's another one at hand
| It's a world ablaze with wonder
| Where nature fills the land
| 
| Like a magic crystal mirror
| Reflected on my screen
| Is an ocean and a forest
| One is blue, and one is green
| 
| Refrain:
| You can only see the shadows
| Of electrons on a screen
| This can only fake an image
| Only show what might have been
| 
| When you play with words and music
| And creation is the game
| Then your symbols have the power
| To become the things they name
| 
| But just once in a long while
| You should try to go outside
| Though your power here is limited
| You cannot always hide
| 
| [Refrain]
| 
| Call us hackers, call us wizards
| For we know it's with disdain
| But we like it here, it's comfortable
| Of nothing we complain
| 
| With our pasty white complexion
| And the LCD's backlight
| We sleep when outside it's day
| And code into the night
