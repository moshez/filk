Man Who Wore the Tin
--------------------

| TTTO "Blowing Winter In", Echo's Children
| 
| Though his attitude is jaded, he still cares for what is right
| And his story is not over, he's not out of this fight
| In the tale of DG coming, in the wind that quickly spins
| Who will lead that silly motely crew? The man who wore the tin
| 
| Now that Oz has turned to darkness, all the people feel the pain
| In the prison that the queen holds, to torment, was summoned rain
| And the palm of that young woman, has a mark burned in her skin
| Who will lead that silly motely crew? The man who wore the tin
| 
| When the hope is dead and buried, and DG's in prison thrown
| She will need the help of all her friends, for she cannot win alone
| She must win against her sister, she must fight her dearest kin
| Who will lead that silly motely crew? The man who wore the tin
| 
| When the fight is all but over, when the enemies advance
| When the one who can still save them, thinks of princesses that dance
| When the younger, better sister, must atone for her vile sin
| Who will lead that silly motely crew? The man who wore the tin
| 
| And the fighting has died down, there still shining bright, the suns
| Still the man who is now victor, he cannot yet hang his gun
| Oz is still quite far from heaven, though it's finally not hell
| For the man who wore the tin has won, and he made sure all is well
