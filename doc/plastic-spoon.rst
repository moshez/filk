Plastic Spoon
-------------

| [TTTO "Paper Moon", Seanan McGuire]
| 
| I like to cook, not eat down in the mall
| I don't want to eat in the dirty bars
| But washing dishes is just not my goal
| Wait I think I hear something -- it's her car
| But that doesn't mean that I'll stop for good
| If I can get away with it, I surely would
| So tell my lover, it's not ending soon,
| Because I'm stirring tea using a plastic spoon
| 
| I don't want to live by another's rules
| I'm not just gonna change, no matter how you sneer
| Your boundaries seem to not much like my tools
| But there ain't no way that I'm stopping, dear
| But just because she gets her way,
| It doesn't mean I won't go back some day
| So tell my lover, it's not ending soon,
| Because I have some rice and a plastic spoon
| 
| [Chorus]
| Plastic spoons and paper bowls
| Paper towels, rolls and rolls
| Though the dinner looks like it's in a mall
| I won't wash dishes, that's my goal
| 
| I do the dishes when she says "goodbye"
| I like paper towells, so I'll take my chance
| To dry the dishes with a good 2-ply
| I do not really care if some will look askance
| Though Iâ€™m somewhere off the beaten track,
| I can guarantee that I won't go back.
| So tell my lover, it's not ending soon...
| I need to eat the soup with a plastic spoon
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| I like to cook, not eat down in the mall
| I don't want to eat in the dirty bars
| But washing dishes is just not my goal
| Wait I think I hear something -- it's her car
| But that doesn't mean I'll stop for good
| If I could get away with it, I surely would
| So tell my lover if she won't come soon,
| I will eat my soup with a plastic spoon,
| I'll consume the rice with a plastic spoon
| She won't see me using a plastic spoon
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Give me plastic spoons and paper bowls,
| Paper towels, rolls and rolls
