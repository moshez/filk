Know the Future
---------------

| TTTO "Einekh Yekholah" by the High Windows
| 
| The doors, now opaque, will be clicking shut soon
| The future, your home, will be yours again
| Machines travel time, are not such a big boon
| Machines travel time, causing unbound pain
| 
| [Chorus]
| You think you know the future, that's not enough
| You think you know the future, wrong on some stuff
| You think you know the future, you made the choices tough
| 
| Your past presence here, really changed the timeline
| You've screwed up the time, there's no going back
| So please stay with me, open up some red wine
| Nukes will fly soon and soon the timeline will crack
| 
| [Chorus]
