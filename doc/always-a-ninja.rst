Always a Ninja
--------------

| TTTO "Always a Woman", Billy Joel
| 
| She can kill with a smile
| She can wound with her eyes
| She can ruin your life without telling a lie
| And she's only noticed when she wants to be seen
| She hides as a child
| But she's always a ninja to me
| 
| She can drop from above
| And annoy her -- they'll grieve you
| Has a cyanide tooth
| She can always deceive you
| And she'll kill whom she wants and then hide in a tree
| She can stand on a leaf
| But she's always a ninja to me
| 
| [Chorus]
| Oh--she takes care of herself
| She can hide if she wants
| And she's always on time
| Oh--and I'll never find out
| Just when did she get in?
| She is so hard to find
| 
| And she'll promise no more
| Than to kill without hurtin'
| As she carefully cuts you
| You'll die 'fore you're bleedin'
| She's the best of the best
| And the worst she can be
| And I just blame myself
| 'Cause she's always a ninja to me
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| She is frequently kind
| Though she knows to be cruel
| She can't do what she pleases
| She follows the rules
| And she won't be convicted
| I think you'll agree
| If you'll irk her, you'll rue
| When the shadows kill you
| But she's always a ninja to me
