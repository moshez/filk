Too Many Stupid Parodies
------------------------

| TTTO "Little Fuzzy Animals", Frank Hayes
| 
| When you come to a house filk, you may quite like what you hear
| There are songs and tunes and parodies and sometimes there is beer
| There are songs that wrench your heart right out and then ones that are just wrong
| And too many stupid parodies of that old song
| 
| There's too many stupid parodies
| Many stupid parodies
| Many stupid parodies of that old song
| 
| Now not all of the the songs you hear should fill you full of dread.
| For the ones that have tunes you've not heard, well, sometimes they ain't bad
| There are parodies of songs you know which can be really fun
| But I think that songs with that old tune should not be done!
| 
| I think that songs with that old tune
| Those songs that have this old tune
| Those songs that have this old tune should not be done
| 
| When nightfall comes to circle and the singers go around
| They will do songs that they wrote themselves and ones that they had found
| It can be lots of fun to hear a thing original and new
| But when they start "fuzzy" things, this day you'll rue
| 
| Yes they start with little fuzzy things
| Start with little fuzzy things
| Start with little fuzzy things -- this day you'll rue
| 
| So when you go to hear and sing you'll know what lies in store
| There are parodies, like this one here, your mind to drill and bore
| So there's only one thing you can do, and you see here the result
| So there's now another parody, I've joined the cult
| 
| Yes there's now another parody
| Now another parody
| Now another parody, I've joined the cult
