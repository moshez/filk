At Amberleaf Fair
-----------------

| Based on "At Amberleaf Fair"
| Lyrics based on the snippets from the book cover.
| No tune yet
| 
| Student and crafter and merchant all here
| Come meet new strangers or friends you hold dear
| Who will be chosen and who will be hurt
| That is the question the young mage will sort
| 
| Magic and mystery await those who dare,
| To enter the game at Amberleaf Fair
| 
| A pendant for citron? Is that a fair trade?
| It is in far places, the merchant has said
| Magic stops stealing but not those who give
| False accusations are hard to forgive
| 
| Come dance and tempt romance and unbraid your hair
| Come hither, make merry at Amberleaf Fair
| 
| Come to the magic show, see things unseen
| The globe showing images of what has been
| Drink up the colors that steal away breath
| Spin fortunes of life, play dark games of death
| 
| Magic and mystery, fates to beware
| Our story unfolds at Amberleaf Fair
| 
| Friends once again as the choices were made
| False accusations to rest now are laid
| All now are leaving, the fair is now done
| Merchant and student and crafter all gone
| 
| Come back next year in the cool autumn air
| See friends and new strangers at Amberleaf Fair
