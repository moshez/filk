| TTTO "מנגב לך את הדמעות" by Shlomo Arzi
| 
| I am putting my armor on, my sword is now strapped to my side
| And I'm stepping into all the fray, though I really desire to hide
| I have given up comforts now, like the sweet linen on top of the bed
| For my mission is simple now -- I'm the one who'll avenge all the dead
| 
| 
| [Chorus]
| The fight must go on, I have come too far to quit
| Through the blood, through the tears, through the sweat and mud and spit
| It's now up to me, and I have to clear my head
| When I'm tempted to quit -- I just think to myself of the dead
| 
| The army has marched on through, and I know scorched earth only's behind
| But I dig through the rubble still, for something, just something, to find
| And I see that my luck still holds, there's a message here from the GM
| Yes I am but a LARPer man, there's no reason my game to condemn
| 
| [Chorus]
