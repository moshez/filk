Laptop Dead
-----------

| TTTO "Gan Sagur" by Gidi Gov
| 
| You boot the machine, the screen is looking fuzzy
| There was an error message and I saw that -- I think the laptop is dead
| 
| The beeps were kinda scary, and I think it's done
| And believe me, that it is the furthest thing from fun
| And I think the laptop is dead
| 
| The hard disk is now grinding, there's no login screen
| And I believe I never witnessed a sadder scene
| The hard disk is now grinding, there's no login screen
| And I believe I never witnessed a sadder scene
| I have looked at this thing with a sense of dread
| But I figure it's now over, I should go to bed
| 
| La,la,la.....
| 
| The hard disk is now grinding, there's no login screen
| And I believe I never witnessed a sadder scene
| The beeps were kinda scary, and I think it's done
| And believe me, that it is the furthest thing from fun
| 
| It's really kinda sad to see a laptop dead
| It's really kinda sad to see a laptop dead
| It's really kinda sad to see a laptop dead
