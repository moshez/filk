My Christmas Vacation (McLain's Lament)
---------------------------------------

| TTTO "My Summer's Vacation (A Slayer's Lament)" by Seanan McGuire
| 
| We've got a man who carries glocks and we have nobody who cares here
| I think he's bringing armageddon, so we'd better not hit the fuse
| I've got a lot of things on my mind, I've got my marriage troubles
| And I think I may be more scared I'll win than I am worried I'll lose
| 
| You know, I didn't volunteer to play a game here, I was threatened
| And I do not hold any views about superiority of any race
| But when criminals call collect, you can't defuse the charges
| So I am standing with a sign here daring people to hit my face
| 
|         This is not how I wanted to spend my Christmas vacation
|         This is not what I wanted to do 'till the end of my days
|         Fighting crime and saving the world may be an honest vocation
|         But it seems all that interests the crowds are flashy displays
| 
| Now it's madness on the first one, on the second strikes the terror
| Or it's pretending to be terror while it takes New York to dry
| By the time we reach the third one I just want it to be over
| But we're still the hits of ratings so we cannot say goodbye
| 
| If I can make it through the fourth one, there's a chance I can just stop this
| And if you really think I mean it, then I've got a script to sell
| We're like a shitty stupid franchise that's evading cancellation
| And I don't think we will stop this 'till this movie is only a shell
| 
|         This is not how I wanted to spend my Christmas vacation...
| 
|                 I used to think my wife was harsh when she left me for this job
|                 Now I'm longing for that sinking feeling, as I have to save
|                         the world from crime and mobs -- again
|                 It's like the police force's a really dumb puppy that's
|                         hell bent on stupid rules
|                 And nobody knows how to get the thing neutered, or make it
|                         stop barking or make it not drool 
| 
| You'd better find another husband if you want a lasting marriage
| I think my life's a running gag that's being told and then retold
| I've got a problem with my wife and no matter how I save her
| There is no way that we'll solve this and stay home and grow old
| 
| So this is life -- I always knew that I'm not going to survive it
| But that doesn't mean I have to be a prison bitch for criminals
| I've got a message for the writers, et. al -- "hate you, the planes and running"
| I'm giving up my gun and cop badge, let's say goodbye now, love me.
| 
|         This is not how I wanted to spend my Christmas vacation.
|         When I chose my career, this is not what I thought I will be.
|         Please enjoy your blood and entrails and eternal uphill battle.
|         I'm giving up my gun and cop badge, let's say goodbye now, love me.
