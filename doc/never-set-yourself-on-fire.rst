| Never set yourself on fire, it hurts and burns and itches
| The heat will only help inspire thoughts of burning witches
| Likewise do not ignite the fen, the con hotel or helpful men
| And never set yourself on fire
| 
| Obey the signs, that FLARE put here, and re: a pyre
| Don't ever set yourself on fire
| 
| Don't walk around without a badge, for you're not undercover
| And if you lose it then you must pay for a new one over
| And though you think your life's a bore, don't hire aliens off the floor
| Don't walk around without a badge,
| 
| Don't walk around without clothes, for we will see right through ya
| "No costume is no custom" rule: it's a simple sane idea
| And though you really like some cats, you cannot bring to the hotel pets
| Don't walk around without clothes
| 
| Don't start an interfandom war, there are no helpful uses
| Is Buffy better? Or is Lost? You'll just light lots of fuses
| If three or thirty fans get hurt, a single fan still won't convert
| Don't start an interfandom war
