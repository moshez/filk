| I am he whose death is all but fate
| I am he the writers kill
| They don't need to be compassionate
| A character can't think or feel
| If you ever see me walk alone
| The next scene you will infer
| I'm good as dead when I'm on my own
| I am the black character
| 
| They will not flesh me out at all
| My lines are trite and without wit
| I know that I must play basketball
| A racist view I have to fit
| I'm written in just meant to die
| I know I have not long to live
| I'll not have time to say goodbye
| But I know that you won't grieve
| 
| Skin black to blend in the dark of night
| My body they won't find 'till day
| They wouldn't treat me so were I white
| That is the genre's way
| There is but one chance left to me,
| My life perhaps from fate to save
| If I will be good at comedy
| I just might avoid the grave
