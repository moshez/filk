The Wise Penguin
----------------

| TTTO "Ha'Ahava Sheli Hi Lo Ha'Ahava Shelo" by Yehonatan Gefen (tune by Yitzhak Klepter)
| 
| I won't forget the sight, a penguin, glasses on his eyes
| And when he looked at me, I somehow knew that he was wise
| I knew I couldn't tell him any lies
| Just like his wings would not fly him to the skies
| The shingles on his roof looked like they're gonna fall
| He looked, and said to me, "I thought that you were gonna call"
| 
| The emeraldish tint that his eyes were starting to get
| From big, meniscus lenses, that I've noticed, the second we met
| His body was all colored, it was strange
| The colors of the rainbow there, from red to blue in range
| His wings had drooped so low, I thought they would fall
| For help that he should get, I was not sure just who to call
| 
| Advice, that was the thing, that I hoped to get from this guy
| He looked so very frail, I thought before he gave it he'd die
| He managed to croak out some senseless words
| And so I say to you, advice you'd get not from the birds
| He died, he could not stand, he had an awful fall
| And instead of flying here, I wish that I had thought to call
