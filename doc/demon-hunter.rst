Demon Hunter
------------

| TTTO "עניין של זמן" by Ehud Manor
| 
| There are things which go bump in the dark
| And I see them taking over school
| These things seem to go without a remark
| Because the principal -- he's quite fool
| 
| [Chorus]
| I am the one who will see them eradicated
| For to this battle I am fated
| By all the demons I am hated
| From their deepest hate in hell
| 
| And my daughter follows in my steps
| Whether I want her to or not
| I will need to train her well
| This thing is vital to the plot
| [End Chorus]
| 
| Though I had my doubts who to trust
| It still seems that they were not enough
| Now to my aid my daughter'll come as she must
| Though her training I've rebuffed
| 
| [Chorus]
