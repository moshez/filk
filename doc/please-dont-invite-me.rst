Please Don't Invite Me
----------------------

| No tune yet.
| 
| I don't want to be a vampire, nor a zombie living dead
| I don't want to level up, nor do I want to get ahead
| If I'll want to be a farmer, I'll just go and buy a farm
| And if I had a zoo, the animals would come to harm
| 
| [Chorus]
| Please don't invite me
| To those facebook applications
| Please let me be free
| From these constant invitations!
| 
| Mafia bosses drive me crazy, the superpoking causes pain
| Please don't try to get me to join your fluff-pet game again
| I just wanted to connect with all my friends around the world
| But I saw them filling quizzes -- the results had made me hurl
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So if you update your status, and you write notes on my wall
| I'll be happy that I met you and I won't forget to call
| But the games that you are playing, can you keep them to your self
| I don't want to be a zombie, or a pirate or an elf!
| 
| [Chorus]
