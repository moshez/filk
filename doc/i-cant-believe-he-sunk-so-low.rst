I Can't Believe He Sunk So Low
------------------------------

| TTTO "Ha'Ahava Sheli", tune by Yitzhak Klepter, original words by Yehonatan Geffen
| 
| You said, although he's dead, that for him you do not grieve
| And that, whatever happens, he will never leave
| I think, my dear, that you are just naive
| If you are choosing now in this vampire to believe
| 
| It seems this vampire now, he sparkles and he glows
| He used to have his dignity, I can't believe he sunk so low
| 
| You said that you would never fear that this vampire will attack
| You said that if you're gone, your scent he'll always track
| You said that if he fails, there's still his pack
| But dear, I think you know that for him you are a snack
| 
| He's posing outdoors, in sunny daylight's glow
| He used to have his dignity, I can't believe he sunk so low
| 
| I think that this charade has by now gone too far
| Whatever rep the vampires had, I think that this one marred
| So now he's getting chicks at every bar
| Like he is some celebrity, perhaps a movie star
| 
| When women look at him, they get a kind of glow
| He used to have his dignity, I can't believe he sunk so low
