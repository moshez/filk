Oops, I did it again

| Neck deep in a fight with some tubes and some beaks
| I noticed it's heating, though not as it should
| When there sprang up a half-dozen quick acid leaks
| Eating through equipment of metal and wood
| It soon became clear that the theory is wrong
| It's too complicated for me to get right
| I tripped on a minus that doesn't belong
| And that was when I had decided to write:
| 
| [Chorus]
| Oops, oops, the data's all wrong here
| When plotting it down, it's not on a line
| Oh well, it's not always right dear
| Science is tricky, I'd rather just whine
| 
| We were shooting the breeze, when we saw in the lab
| A cyclotron idle, we wired it up
| We added ingredients, all that we could grab
| Poured the results that we had in a cup
| It ate through containers, 'till we found the one
| To hold it all safely, our lab was destroyed
| But we can say when it's all said and done
| That old 307 by all was enjoyed
| 
| We had words with advisors, "go lost" we were told
| When we saw this miracle wouldn't repeat
| Reproduction was tried in some labs 'round the world
| But it seems none of them could accomplish the feat
| We knew not what to do, how the ale to produce
| Until we we had noticed and squaked with no grace
| All it took to create this magnificent juice
| Was crossing some wires, and folding some space
