The Guy Who's Keeping the Minutes
---------------------------------

| TTTO "The Guy Who Changes the Light Bulbs" by Carla Ulbrich
| 
| [Chorus]
| The guy who's keeping the minutes, changes everything
| He makes things as they were never, and retconning he brings
| He's got power, he makes meaning, he makes sure of things
| The guy who's keeping the minutes -- changes everything
| 
| See -- the thing he wrote that you have said has not been said by you
| And while you might agree with that, it's not a thing to do
| And here's another problem for which there's no excuse --
| The yes to no --- oh I don't know -- that's a thin-veiled ruse
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| When the guy who's keeping the minutes has a boss who's a tightwad
| The only project not cancelled, is that guy's -- I am so glad!
| I have by now know not to read it on the cellphone in my car
| Sometimes it is funny --  sometimes mad is all we are
| 
| It's might as well be French or Chinese, or a contract done by Faust
| When you read them, you'll be yelling, so please do so in your house
| And whatever may befall you, you will never see them raw
| For the edits to the minutes are the things that make them go!
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So the guy who every morning, discusses some new paper
| Or comes into your cube with a new story of a caper
| Is the guy who's taking the notes, acting like he's your confesser
| And gets you talking for hours like you do with your hairdresser
| 
| If you're feeling unimportant, like you might as well go fishing
| Then just go, and then read the minutes -- it's not like you'll be missing
| Anything that's true's in minutes -- that's the most important job
| When we're missing, we can't miss him -- though the minutes sound odd!
| He's got power, he makes meanings -- he's practically a god
| The guy who's keeping the minutes has the most important job
