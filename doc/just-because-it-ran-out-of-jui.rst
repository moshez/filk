Just Because It Ran Out of Juice
--------------------------------

| TTTO "Rak Bishvil Lekabel Hibuk" by Eifo Ha'Yeled
| 
| I am hoping for more time before I have to charge again
| And the LED is blinking now, I think it will be over soon
| The movie I saw was too long and the network have been a constant drain
| I am getting the warning now, and I haven't charged, I think, since noon
| 
| [Chorus]
| And it is shutting down -- now
| This is final
| It's now
| This is final
| And the screen has gotten black
| Just because it ran out of juice
| Just because it ran out of juice
| 
| So the charging is a must
| Or your device is going bust
| Oh I know you cried and fussed
| But it's not unjust
| 
| The power in this device has limits still
| It's needed now, so chord inside the charging hole please thrust
| 
| [Chorus]
