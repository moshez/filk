Blind Date on My Island
-----------------------

| TTTO "Blind Date on the Island of Dr. Moreau" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| I watch you sleep there next to me
| This does not happen to me often
| I fall alseep and dream about our future
| Specifically, on how you escape this coffin
| I was a bit rough,
| You called the police off-
| icers, and I fear it's too late
| To continue our date
| 
| [Chorus]
| I saw an ad: Sexy scientist seeks Mr. Right
| For romantic walks on the beach and labwork late in to the night
| I rushed to reply to that online ad that I saw
| I don't wish to get my hopes up, and by so doing invoke Murphy's law
| I know there are so many spammers on Craig's list who're baiting
| So here it goes, I'll dip my toes into this "online dating"
| 
| I knew that you're into chemistry
| And this, I'm happy to say, I know best
| So I showed you just how with acid's I'm skilled
| And tried to woo you with a litmus test
| As I prepared to meet you
| I hoped that you'd be sweet but,
| You taste a lot like mussel
| Eating you was just a hassle
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So guys if you meet a girl who
| Seems sweet but has a friend with a chainsaw
| Tell her the two of you are through
| But could you ask her friend to go out?
| And just take out the LART
| No, really, use the LART
| And enjoy a night of terror
| Just do not repeat my error
| 
| [Chorus]
| I saw an ad: Sexy scientist seeks Mr. Right
| For romantic walks on the beach and labwork late in to the night
| I rushed to reply to that online ad that I saw
| I guess I got my hopes up, and by so doing invoked Murphy's law
| I knew there are so many spammers on Craig's list who're baiting
| And so it went, not how I meant, this deal with "online dating"
| 
| Well maybe I'll destroy the world...
