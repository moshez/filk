Mail is All Around
------------------

| TTTO "Love is All Around", Reg Presely
| 
| I feel it in my pocket
| I feel it in my hand
| It's got me in its fingers
| I bow to its demands
| It's in the air, I know it
| It's everywhere I go, oh, yes it is
| So if you really love me
| Click "send" and let it show
| 
| [Chorus]
| I know I got it, I just can feel
| Vibrations rock my body
| Let me know it's real
| There's no beginning,
| There'll be no end,
| As long as mail I receive and send
| 
| I put my phone on "vibrate"
| And now with every mail
| My pants have got to buzzing
| And my face grows pale
| The phone will now command me, and I
| Do its bidding now
| When mail or calls now reach me
| To its will I bow
| 
| [Chorus]
