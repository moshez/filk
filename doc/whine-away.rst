Whine Away
----------

| TTTO "Tune Away!" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| You've pulled some facts right out of your ass
| We hoped that you were done, but not so - alas
| And we know that we all are in for a treat
| As this old dead horse, you soon will beat
| 
| [Chorus]
| Whine away! Whine away, guys
| For you know we want to hear your cries
| Whine away! We will stay right here
| 'Till you've said your complaints for us to hear
| 
| In life you sometimes have to endure
| Some unpleasantness but there is a cure
| If you just shed tears and say "it's not fair"
| And shout enough, we will come to care
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Some people die and starve on the street
| And others try hard to make the ends meet
| But if your toe is stubbed or someone is rude
| Just cry and pout, and twist and shout, and also brood
| 
| [Chorus]
