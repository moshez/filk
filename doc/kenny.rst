| TTTO "Mary Ellen Carter" by Stan Rogers
| 
| He died again last episode, amidst the pouring rain
| He drowned in a pothole and his last breath came in pain
| He did the same before that, for each one deals mortal blows
| Though the humor in his death is kind of low
| He went up in a fire and has left a pile of ash
| And nobody could save him, and no one really tried
| And as the plot was silly, it has caused us to proclaim
| That the poor kid who mumbles died again
| 
| Well the writers wrote him off, not a thought for him they'll spend
| They needed him to die for them, and so his life would end
| And he soon became fan-favorite, the boy who would not go
| So his soul would not stay in the sky, or in the hell below
| Despite of all his dying, in the series he'll remain
| Though the poor kid who mumbles died again
| 
| [Chorus]
| Dies again, dies again,
| Let the God take his soul as he does with all the men 
| All those who were his friends and were with him to the end
| They will know the kid who mumbles die again
| 
| All summer we have waited for the show had to return
| We want to see him poked and pushed, to see his body burn
| And though he is not stupid, and you cannot call him slow,
| He somehow still knows not to death he'll go
| But we watched the show, glued to the screen, and saw him going down
| We saw him dead and gone and now he's buried in the ground
| He was too shocked and scared and now his heart won't take the strain
| As, again, the kid who mumbles dies again
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| But we know that one day, not that soon, he will not make the grade
| And nobody, not friend nor foe, will rush to give him aid
| And he'll keep on, dead and buried, rotting slowly in his grave
| When his life will never another day
| And you to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
| When fate cruel hand has hit you hard, to quick grave you will go
| At least a hope remains to you, if you like to eat brain
| As a zombie, from the ground, rise again
| 
| Dies again, dies again
| Though by now it is known that his death is not his end
| No matter what he is to you, a character or friend
| For we know the kid who mumbles dies again
