Cyanide is Natural
------------------

| TTTO "Chocolate is a Vegetable" by Graham Leathers
| 
| Now all of your life, you're told you're better with organics
| This industrial stuff is crap
| White sugar, white flour or processed peanut butter
| Are all commercial traps
| Now here's a kind of advice
| If you want to do some vice
| And you want to kill some health nut sap
| Bitter almonds are the way
| To have a better day
| And to cause a slightly permanent nap
| 
| [Chorus]
| Cyanide is natural, it comes from a nut
| That grows on a plant called a tree
| It lives in the forest with its other tree brothers
| Yes cyanide is natural you see
| X2
| 
| In the mediterrenian there lives a little tree
| With its flowers all colored in pink
| And in these there is potential
| To make a confidential
| Poison lots of people drink
| Although some people think you can't
| This tree is just a plant
| With roots in the soil where it grows
| The sting of the trees
| Is more lethal than of bees
| And like them they can cause some woes
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| If you don't want them to detect your murderous intentions
| Then this poison should be on your brain
| It's organic, not a fake
| And it kills for heaven's sake
| And not using it is plain insane
| Just takes seconds for to kill
| You don't need to use the pills
| I suggest that you can get a clue-in
| It's just wonderful means
| To kill with no machines
| What else would a body be doing
| 
| [Chorus]
