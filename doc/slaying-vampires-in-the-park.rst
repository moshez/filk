Slaying Vampires in the Park
----------------------------

| OMG! I found some of my ooold Buffy filk.
| 
| TTTO "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park"
| 
| Spring is here, a-suh-pring is here
| Life is skittles and life is beer
| I think the loveliest time of the year is the spring,
| I do, don't you? 'Course you do
| 
| But there's one thing that makes spring complete for me
| And makes every midnight a treat for me
| All the world seems all right
| In the spring at midnight
| As we slay the vampires in the park
| Ev'ry midnight you'll see
| My sweetheart and me,
| As we slay the vampires in the park
| 
| When they see us coming, the vampires all try an' kill
| But we smile to ourselves and just practice our daily drill
| The moon's shining bright
| Ev'rything seems all right
| When we slay the vampires in the park
| 
| We've gained notoriety,
| And caused much anxiety
| In the vampire society
| With our games.
| 
| They call it impiety,
| And lack of propriety,
| And quite a variety
| Of unpleasant names.
| 
| But we're not afraid of their sires
| As we kill newly born vampires
| 
| So if midnight you're free,
| Why don't you come with me,
| And we'll slay the vampires in the park.
| 
| And maybe we'll do
| In a demon or two,
| While we slay the vampires in the park.
| 
| We'll dust them all up them all amid laughter and merriment.
| Except for the few we take home to experiment.
| Situation is dire
| But you've got to admire
| The dust from vampire
| (A splinter's all we require)
| To slay a vampire in the park.
