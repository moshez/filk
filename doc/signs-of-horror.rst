Signs of Horror
---------------

| TTTO "Banned from Argo" by Leslie Fish
| 
| When filkers gather in a con, they teach each other things
| They talk of signs and languages, and what they like to sing
| And sometimes what they teach can be a little scary too
| But, see, we are just filkers, and it's what like to do
| 
| [Chorus]
| 'Cause we like chainsaw murders, and delight
| In scaring mundanes -- we draw power from their fright
| So listen to me carefully, or watch if you can't hear
| "I'll kill you with a chainsaw" you should fear
| 
| There is a lady from the west, she sings of horror tales
| Of zombies, vampires, ofdead things and how death looks so pale
| She likes to carry chainsaws, and strange languages to speak
| And made sure she can frighten everyone, from every clique
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| There another lady who knows ASL real well
| When she is asked about a sign she'll do her best to tell
| She's patient -- she's a teacher -- and her lessons are so good
| That when she teaches something she'll make sure she's understood
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| There is another guy who hails from somewhere in the east
| He listened to the lesson, and did not a iota missed
| He knew to say the sentence that the lady from the west
| Had asked the other lady to teach her, as she can best
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| He went back to his homeland, and the stories that he told
| Had lessons buried in them, but just one was to unfold
| He made sure he repeated all the signs the teacher taught
| And didn't think if it was smart, if that's just what he ought
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So now all of the engineers who listened to his words
| Remember, now, that they are still to some extent all nerds
| They all know ASL, a bit, and this is what they know --
| Listen to me carefully, and watch me as I show:
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| But I'm from Israel, as you now know
| And so my local culture, to you I want to show
| Our area seems doomed to war, some people think it's fate
| So if you come you should know this is "hate"
