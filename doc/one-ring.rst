One Ring
--------

| Tune: original
| 
| We looked for them, oh, everywhere, we looked both high and low
| We thought that we would kill them all wherever they may go
| We could not seem to find them and no matter how we tried
| Until we got how to expose the places where they hide
| 
| [Chorus]
| One ring to rule them all
| And One ring to find them
| One ring to make the call
| And in the darkness bind them
| 
| And so we got our cellphones out and dialed out the right thing
| And waited there so patiently until we heard the ring
| The cellphones had betrayed their lords, they ratted out the fools
| I guess next time they will make sure to quiet their own tools
| 
| [Chorus]
