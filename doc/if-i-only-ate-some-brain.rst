If I Only Ate Some Brain
------------------------

| TTTO "If I Only Had a Brain" from "The Wizard of Oz"
| 
| I could scare away the cowards
| As for food I have scoured
| And I would not dare complain
| And my itch I'd be scratchin'
| And the victims dispatching
| If I only ate some brain.
| 
| I'd consume every grey cell
| It would be just like in hell
| With trouble and some pain
| 
| With the teeth that are sinkin'
| Yes, my lips I'd be lickin'
| If I only ate some brain
| 
| Oh, I could tell you why
| The skull's best is at the core
| I could eat brains like I never ate before
| And then I'd go and eat some more.
| 
| I would not be just a nuffin'
| As my face I'd be stuffin'
| I would not experience pain
| I would dance and be merry
| And I would put on top a cherry
| When I only ate some brain
