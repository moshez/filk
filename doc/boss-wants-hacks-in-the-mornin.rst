| Boss wants
| Hacks in the morning
| Hacks in the morning
| When I'm not my best
| Boss wants
| Hacks in the morning
| Hacks in the morning
| Wants me not to test
| Boss wants
| Someone who'll program
| Someone to code
| Someone to type "make"
| Boss wants
| Someone who'll fix bugs
| Someone with nose plugs
| When I'm half awake
| 
| Boss wants
| Hacks in the morning
| Hacks in the morning
| He'll say nicely "please"
| Boss wants
| Loops with conditions
| Var definitions
| When we're in code freeze
| 
| There is nothing I like better
| Than a program now and then
| When with adding just a letter
| I can fix it, crash will mend
| But before my eyes are open
| Of these things I can't decide
| What on earth have I been smoking
| When by zero I divide
| 
| Boss wants
| Hacks in the morning
| Hacks in the morning
| No one in the streets
| Boss wants
| Code while I'm yawning
| Sun is just dawning
| And I'm half-asleep
| Boss knows
| I am unconcious
| I know I must
| Though I have no skill
| Boss wants
| Code with surprises
| Code with the sunrise
| When I want to kill
| 
| There's nothing like a system
| With the basics done just right
| Though to build it we went sleepless
| And worked late into the night
| But before my eyes can focus
| I know it is not wise
| To descend just like a locus
| On the code when it's this size
| 
| Boss wants
| Hacks in the morning
| Hacks in the morning
| Save, load and refresh
| Boss wants
| Someone to code it
| Someone to load it
| Fiddle with the mesh
| Boss wants
| Someone to fake and
| Someone to shake and
| Break down into cries
| Boss wants
| Someone to clean this
| Someone who's seen this
| With tears in their eyes
