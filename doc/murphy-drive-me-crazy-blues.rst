Murphy Drive Me Crazy Blues

| TTTO "David Drive Me Crazy Blues", Echo's Children
| 
| The breakage that's hidden is not overridden
| But somehow it will seem to work
| The thing that went "crack", the little planned hack
| Will keep on quiet and lurk
| And just when I had no doubt that the faults they are out
| Some unlikely spark breaks the fuse
| I've got the listen to mother, don't even bother, Murphy drive me crazy blues
| 
| The advances we made only made us afraid
| When machines break and leave us alone
| We'd have got more response to our wishes and wants
| If our need, we had not plainly shown
| But the machine has no mind, at least none we can find
| Though it does all it can to confuse
| I've got the listen to mother, don't even bother, Murphy drive me crazy blues
| 
| We hope and we pray that it won't go away
| That the damn thing will work as we planned
| We don't want to get hurt, with disaster we flirt
| And we don't want this thing to be banned
| And if we're going to pay, with our tears anyway,
| Tell me, what do we get if we lose?
| I've got the listen to mother, don't even bother, Murphy drive me crazy blues
| 
| This couldn't be true, I did not think it through
| The excuses are dozen a dime
| Fear of the fire will surely require
| The factors of safety to climb
| Because when bonefires start and we see we're not that smart
| And the metal and plastic will ooze
| I've got the listen to mother, don't even bother, Murphy drive me crazy blues
