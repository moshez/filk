The Moon is High

| TTTO "The Tide is High", by Blondie

| Context: In Israel, when I was a kid, the "Bazuka" gum came with a stupid joke and a "fortune". Half of those said "By the time you're 21, you'll reach the moon." Well, guess what, Bazuka gum makers?
| 
| The moon is high but I'll reach it soon
| I plan to go to the moon
| I'm not the kind of guy
| Who gives up 'till he'll die
| Oh, no
| 
| It's just the things I read
| When I was just a kid
| To believe it, they have lead
| And so believe I did
| I'm not the kind of guy
| Who gives up 'till he'll die
| Oh, no
| 
| The moon is high but I'll reach it soon
| I plan to go to the moon
| To the moon
| 
| Every boy read the same old prophecy
| When you'll be twenty-one then on the moon you'll be
| I'm not the kind of guy
| Who gives up 'till he'll die
| Oh, no
| 
| The moon is high but I'll reach it soon
| I plan to go to the moon
| To the moon
| To the moon
| 
| Every boy read the same old prophecy
| By age twenty-one then on the moon you'll be
| I'm not the kind of guy
| Who gives up 'till he'll die
| Oh, no
| 
| The moon is high but I'll reach it soon
| I plan to go to the moon
| To the moon
| To the moon
| 
| The moon is high but I'll reach it soon
| I plan to go to the moon
| To the moon
| To the moon
