The Last War
------------

| TTTO "If I Had a Rocket Launcher" by Bruce Cockburn
| 
| I see the zombies coming -- just at the end of day
| They're crawling forward, shambling, they will not go away
| How many more are taken, no one here can say
| If I had a sawed off shotgun...the outcome I could sway
| 
| I did not believe in zombies, did not believe in fate
| But it's time to go to war now, we cannot sit and wait
| When we gather the survivors, our tales of horror we relate
| If I had a power chain saw...I would retaliate!
| 
| This war is not for power and it's not about hate
| And by now we cannot win it, I fear that it's too late
| Cry for every soldier who has died defending gates
| If I had a big flame thrower...I would not hesitate
| 
| But I'm huddled in the closet, with the tears on my cheeks dry
| I want to shout "we can make it, if we don't give up and try!"
| Situation desperate, to myself I cannot lie
| All I've got is a revolver...I think I'd rather die!
