Shellscript
-----------

| I bang the keyboard -- but you understand
| The work is piling at a higher rate
| Instead of doing this hard work by hand
| I really should just automate
| 
| [Chorus]
| It's a shellscript, just a script of shell --
| But I don't know just how I could tell
| It's a victim of its own success
| As I'm maintaining this unholy mess
| 
| Data's growing, and the files are flat
| Performance sucking, something must be done
| It must be accessed by this thing and that
| Just add a DB, it is fun!
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now people saying that it's hard to use
| And all this typing is a pain
| Without menus, buttons, we will lose
| I'll add a GUI, don't complain
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Now we're selling this, we have no shame
| But the customers don't stop to call
| I keep on saying that it's really lame
| But all good programs started small!
| 
| [Chorus]
