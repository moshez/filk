| TTTO "Bested", Echo's Children
| 
| Now that the con's at the end, we bow at the end of the show
| This con is over, now go get the hearse
| We are all finished, we have done our worst
| T'was fun but we now have to go
| 
| Now that we all had our fun, now that we spent all our dough
| We bought all the glitter, and some bought a chain
| We want to sleep now, our muscles in pain
| T'was fun but we now have to go
| 
| Trying to sleep in the dark, we still can recall every blow
| All the mock battles we saw our friends lose
| Beaten and tricked how they fell for a ruse
| T'was fun but we now have to go
| 
| Forbidden to leave in mid-con, to our home, at long last, we can go
| Eardrums that split from the too-loud band,
| Talks that were long, that we don't understand
| T'was fun but we now have to go
| 
| Now that the car has drove off, out, all of us, they did throw
| Now we are finished and we are all done
| You can be sure that it's not the last one 
| T'was fun but we now have to go
