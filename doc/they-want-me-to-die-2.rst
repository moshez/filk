They Want Me to Die
-------------------

| TTTO "בלדה בין כוכבים" by אדם
| 
| A song about the "Die Hard" series of movies.
| 
| I took off my shoes and made fists with my feet
| The jetlag to heal, it's a fine trick
| With bare feet and a gun I will now have to beat
| And find lots of bad guy ass to kick
| I'll shoot, jump and fall,
| Find beat cops to call
| Until I will get to punch news-dicks
| 
| [Chorus]
| I don't why
| These people all want me to die
| I think that I'm going to cry
| Gonna cry
| And keep fighting
| 
| It's christmas again, and I'm meeting my wife
| I should have expected the fighting
| For it seems to be the bad fate of my life
| Or possibly, just some bad writing
| I saved her again, Ms. Holly McLain
| And once again christmas's exciting
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Just how many times I can try to survive
| The villains who try to steal money
| The gold just sits still, waits for them to arrive
| Their plots are so said that's they're funny
| The bits that they steal, are scarily real
| And now they have kidnapped my honey
| 
| [Chorus]
