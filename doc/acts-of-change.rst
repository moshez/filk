Acts of Change
--------------

| [Chorus]
| When you're in McGongal's classroom, please be quiet, listen well,
| Pay attention to the teacher, and please learn that spell
| You can switch your form around, though it does appear so strange
| Every transfiguration is an act of change
| 
| From the wizard hurling hexes, using spells that he has found
| Through the witches brewing poison, to the people killed and drowned
| In this world of charm and magic, when it's easy to destroy
| Every Avra Kedavra is an act of joy
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| You can study dreams and star charts, you can use a crystal ball
| But you need to have the talent, or you can't be helped at all
| We are reaching for the future, and it's not beyond our scope
| Every cast divinition is an act of hope
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| You can learn to be an auror, and the dark arts to defuse
| It's a fight of good and evil, and a side you have to choose
| Harry was a small child, frightened, when a spell his mother wove
| For there's nothing that's stronger than a mother's love
| 
| [Chorus]
