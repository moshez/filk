Moore's Law
-----------

| TTTO "Loke'ach Ta'Zman" from "Zlil Mechuvan"
| 
| When the CPU was new, back then
| This guy, the call him Moor, this law he invented
| It would double in transistors, time and again
| It had since been quoted often, and poorly represented
| But more transistors on a chip
| Mean faster hardware costing less
| And so computers have been growing still
| And it will not stop I guess, yeah
| 
| In the year of 1971
| 10 micrometers chip, state-of-art represented
| But these chips would be pretty soon outdone
| 3 micrometers chips, in just 4 years they were invented
| And just in 7 or so years
| They made 1-point-5 microns
| And they would not be done with this for years
| They would still hit the milestones, yeah
| 
| But software has been slowing through the years
| With faster hardware, we still wait 'till we're in tears
| With more and more transistors we are hit
| The programs just run slower bit by bit
| Some people write their working code in languages with a VM
| And I say that if the code is working fine, that I would like to join them
| 
| 90 nanomilimeters are the rage
| We've all got those chips, and still the things are growing faster
| For, you will see, in this nano day and age
| 11 nanomilis with the quantum stuff to master
| We still do not know what we'll do
| When we have gone so small as that
| But we'll have 10 more years to figure out
| And we are taking our time, yeah
