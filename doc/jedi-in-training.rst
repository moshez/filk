Jedi in Training
----------------

| TTTO "Natati La Khayay"
| 
| Back in the days that were not told, lost to backstory
| Back in the days when men were men, pursuing glory
| Back when republics fell, and empires ascended
| Back when the order of the jedis almost ended
| Father's taught, and now the son
| With lightsabre, stop a gun
| It's your shift,
| Rocks to lift
| So now go ahead 
| 
| [Chorus]
| Do or do not, don't try
| No matter how you cry
| You'll learn to lift the stuff
| Until you're good enough
| To be a jedi
| 
| You are now training to defeat your evil father
| And if you fail, the fight you lose, there is another
| Though Yoda's dead now, so there is no one to train her
| I fear it falls to you, no matter how it pains her
| Concentrate, you must train well
| While in this cold swamp you dwell
| Please be good
| As you should
| And now go ahead
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| And just when all was lost, your daddy killed his ruler
| I guess that when it's said and done, he was just cooler
| Your training was not worth that much, but never mind it
| We could not hope, in such short time, much to refind it
| But it served well to distract
| 'Till your daddy did the act
| He is dead
| See his head
| And at least you can
| 
| [Chorus]
