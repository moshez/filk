The Girl That is Thirteen
-------------------------

| TTTO "Thirteen" by Michelle Dockrey
| 
| Based on "The Girl That's Never Been" by Michelle Dockrey
| 
| It was sixteen years outside a movie, the show was aging, and I was found
| I had not a thing except a photo, and a blue dress here in this town
| I know the story, but I can't know now, if it's a dream or it is true
| The shrinks all told me I've imagined, "you're not Alice, she's not you"
| 
| [Chorus]
| Alcohol and LSD
| I had little pity on me
| Humpty said I should stop at seven
| Tell me what does it mean
| The girl that's never been
| 
| Cheshire tell me where I'm going, Cheshire tell me where I've been
| Am I just imagination? Are we long-lost orphaned kin?
| I have needed to go back there, I do not think it's a sin
| Now your words of hint and taunt, they get underneath my skin
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| Cheshire tell me all your stories, Cheshire sing me all your rhymes
| Though so long I have been clean now, I want to go back this time
| What's the answer to the riddle, of the raven from my call?
| It is nothing like a desk now, it is nothing like at all
| 
| [Chorus]
