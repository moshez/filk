I Meant to Code That
--------------------

| TTTO "I Meant to Do That" by Echo's Children
| 
| The coders all chase hard bugs as the users demand
| But sometimes the requests will start to get out of hand
| We'll ramble and we will rant and we will start to swear
| "You see, it can't be," we told all who were there
| 
| (We said)
| We meant to do that, oh don't you suppose,
| We did it on purpose for a technical cause
| Since you're just the users, and we wrote the code
| We thought we ought to say it's just the crash-happy mode
| 
| 
| Our system sometimes crashes just to give you a scare
| When given too much load, it stops, we crash 'cause we care
| When the core files litter the hard drives, the system won't boot
| Restoring it will need the tender cares of the "root"
| 
| (He'll say)
| ...
| 
| When we do something foolish, we won't run and hide
| Those cynical souls say we're salving our pride
| We'll pull ourselves together, and we'll mumble in geek
| You'll guess that the solution takes no less than a week
| 
| (We'll say)
| ...
| 
| 
| From a coder's book of etiquette, this lesson please take:
| You don't have to be embarassed if you make a mistake
| Just mumble something geeky 'bout "non-standard load"
| And tell the watching crowd, "you know, it's hard to write code"
| 
| (And say)
