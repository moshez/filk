McFly

| TTTO "I Want To Die (Like They Do In Sci-Fi)" by Brooke Lunderville
| 
| Mr. McFly is a real poor old nerd
| Though his young boy's a musician to be
| He's friends with a scientist that has no beard
| And there's one person he'll soon again see --
| 
| [Chorus]
| You want to die, oh
| I think so, McFly
| You're gonna do what I say
| Or I will make your ass pay
| You want to die
| Oh, I think so McFly 
| If you will do something new
| You'll gain it all or this rue
| 
| So we'll travel to the past, where you'll do damage that won't last
| Or perhaps we'll see the future 'cause we must save your kids
| We will split up the timeline, 'cause it so screws with your mind
| And then to put it all back we will risk all with brave deeds
| 
| [Chorus]
| 
| So now we're finally back, and now the world has no lack
| And the old nemesis Biff now does all that we command
| It took three movies to go, it was a marvelous show
| For some time-travel is weird, and it is hard to be planned
| 
| Biff's gonna die
| He is now ruled by McFly
| He's gonna do what he says
| Or he will make his ass pay
| Biff's gonna die
| He is now ruled by McFly
| Who says there is nothin new?
| For there is change that is true
