Standard Party
--------------

| No tune yet.
| 
| If there is treasure to be found, you'll have to fight you know
| Because its guards will tend to be quite sad to see it go
| So get your act together, get some friends to help along
| And if you keep to standards, you are not likely to go wrong
| 
| See the ISO standards page
| A cleric and a fighter
| And the thief and clever mage
| And no party can be tighter
| 
| If you want want just to hack it, you can do with somewhat less
| The ISO is a bit too long, you can conserve, I guess
| But you can't do just want you want, so here's what you can do
| There's something that is easier, and here's a little clue
| 
| IETF's standard's homepage
| The cleric is the fighter
| And the thief is too a mage
| And no party can be lighter
| 
| You know there's all this money in the treasures that we find
| And parties that have pooled their skills, their talents they combined
| So with the money, come the fools, who think they'll do as well
| And now we've got this standard, and I can corruption smell
| 
| See the ECMA's standards page
| Druid cleric, and no fighter
| Illusionist - not a mage
| And the party'll die tonight - er...
