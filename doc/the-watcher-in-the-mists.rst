The Watcher in the Mists
------------------------

| TTTO "The Collars" by Michelle Dockrey
| Based on the "Mistborn" trilogy by Brandon Sanderson
| NOTE: SPOILERS UNTIL THE END OF BOOK THREE
| 
| I have grown up only watching, as my gaze had pierced the mists
| The more I burn the tin, the more my vision it assists
| I joined the crew by default, I could see they had no choice
| I learned to look and listen and to seldom use my voice
| I have kept to darkness, shadows, always seeing, never seen
| Keeping still inside my secret place behind a misty screen
| 
| And the things that I am seeing I am helpless to affect
| I can only watch and listen, not direct
| 
| Though I know not what has happend now I'm strong as well as keen
| As the pewter helps me quell the pain that's brought on by my tin
| All have seen me brave the fire, I'm survivor of the flame
| I cannot stay here uninvolved so I have joined the game
| Now I'm hearing voices constantly, they're telling me to kill
| I cannot help but listen still their wish I won't fullfill
| 
| And the things that I am seeing am I helpless to affect?
| Can I only watch and listen, not direct?
| 
| I have given up my newfound strength, a watcher I'll remain
| And the voices have all gone away, I won't hear them again
| My report is etched in metal so it blinds the prying eye
| I have sent away the knowledge for my role is but to spy
| I can only hope and pray now, I can only wait and see
| For a watcher's what I am and I need no one watching me
| 
| The things that I am seeing I'm not helpless to affect
| Though I only watch and listen, not direct
