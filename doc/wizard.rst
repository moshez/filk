| Another bug in the code tonight
| Just over here, it is not quite right
| Dawn's not too far away
| 
| I heard the newbies chat on IRC
| Will they have something good to see
| When they wake up the next day
| 
| Well it's late at night and the stars are deep
| That's ok I don't need sleep
| Coffee's helpful for quite some time
| 
| But I have to fix that situation
| And I need to clone that application
| 'Cause I know that it can't run on WINE
| 
| I think that some ideas I found
| When I searched and looked around
| And I need to rest my brain
| 
| The compile is slow and I have to wait
| And I hope that it won't make it late
| The compiler is so lame
| 
| The file format is not quite understood
| The standard says "must" and not "should"
| I feel like I've hit a wall
| 
| And I don't know when and I don't know how
| And I think I will fix this somehow
| This problem is so small
| 
| Well I remember the day I started here
| Tinged with excitement and some fear
| As I'm coding up this clone
| 
| They said "such good programs can't be free"
| They mocked my crashes, and they laughed at me
| As I'm coding this now alone
| 
| The pundits kissed my chance goodbye
| And said "there is no chance, it will die,
| It won't change a thing 'round here"
| 
| And over their shoulders, high on their horse
| The users read and they said "of course,
| Let's away this failure we will steer"
| 
| The hackers cheered when they saw my smile
| The hits went up and slashdot went wild
| As this day I won the race
| 
| For hours coding made their mark
| Hunched and typing in the dark
| I can hardly wait to see the user's face
